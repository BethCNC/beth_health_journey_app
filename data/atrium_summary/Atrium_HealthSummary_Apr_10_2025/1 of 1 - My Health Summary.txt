PROCEDURE: Informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the fluoroscopy table. The skin anterior to the right shoulder was marked and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Following adequate local anesthesia with 1%  Xylocaine, a 22-gauge spinal needle was introduced into the glenohumeral joint. Permanent image was obtained with the needle in the joint. Following administration of Xylocaine, approximately 12-15 cc of dilute gadolinium (0.1 cc of gadolinium mixed with Xylocaine and contrast) was injected during intermittent fluoroscopic observation. The needle was removed and hemostasis was achieved. The patient tolerated the procedure well without apparent complication.  FLUORO TIME: 18 seconds.  NUMBER OF IMAGES: 4 fluoroscopic images.  INTERPRETATION: Contrast injected into the glenohumeral joint remains within the glenohumeral joint without evidence of extravasation to suggest full thickness rotator cuff tear.    Procedure Note Kevin Carroll, MD - 05/08/2018 Formatting of this note might be different from the original.

The skin anterior to the right shoulder was marked and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Following adequate local anesthesia with 1%  Xylocaine, a 22-gauge spinal needle was introduced into the glenohumeral joint. Permanent image was obtained with the needle in the joint. Following administration of Xylocaine, approximately 12-15 cc of dilute gadolinium (0.1 cc of gadolinium mixed with Xylocaine and contrast) was injected during intermittent fluoroscopic observation. The needle was removed and hemostasis was achieved. The patient tolerated the procedure well without apparent complication.  FLUORO TIME: 18 seconds.  NUMBER OF IMAGES: 4 fluoroscopic images.  INTERPRETATION: Contrast injected into the glenohumeral joint remains within the glenohumeral joint without evidence of extravasation to suggest full thickness rotator cuff tear.    Procedure Note Kevin Carroll, MD - 05/08/2018 Formatting of this note might be different from the original.

Caucasian female with presumed psoriatic arthritis   1.  Presumed psoriatic arthritis: Ongoing symptoms. With prior pain in the left wrist and right knee.  She finds that prednisone does not help with this pain.  Prior testing shows negative ANA, rheumatoid factor, CCP, HLA-B27, uric acid, ESR, CRP. HCQ started 3/2022, discontinued in 5/2022 due to ringing in the ears. MTX started in May 2022.  She has found benefit from prednisone in the past   2. Use of high-risk medications: Methotrexate, due for labs, no serious infections or hospitalizations..   3. History of bulimia: With ongoing symptoms of decreased food intake.  She does take NSAIDs daily, but also finds that she has nausea daily and requires Zofran.   4. History of degenerative disc disease in the cervical spine: With ongoing pain. Status post C4-C5, C5-C6 ACDF in September 2018. Daily Ibuprofen.   5. Autoimmune thyroid disease: With positive thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase antibodies noted in 2018.  Recent testing does reveal abnormal thyroid function.  She is not currently on any thyroid medications. Plan:  Continue methotrexate 10mg by mouth weekly with daily folic acid  Check CBC, creatinine, hepatic function panel  Consider increasing MTX to 15mg PO weekly vs adding Otezla vs Cosentyx  She is aware that our office policy restricts my ability to prescribe nonrheumatic medications, and that I would defer management of such to her other providers  I encouraged her to continue to follow with her other providers as previously scheduled   Return to office in 4 months  To assess for drug toxicity continue monitoring blood tests once every 12 weeks .   I spent 25 minutes of face-to-face time with the patient and more than half of the time was devoted to patient education discussing about the importance of increasing physical activity; DMARD side effects; and current management plans.    Subjective:  Jennifer Beth Cartrette is a 40 y.o. female who is here for follow-up of psoriatic arthritis. They were last evaluated in the Rheumatology Department in May 2022. At that time, she was to start methotrexate 10 mg by mouth weekly with daily folic acid  Since then, she has not noted significant benefit, but she has noted increase in stress and overuse of her joints, which has worsened her symptoms.  She does feel that she has had less swelling, but she can notice an increase in stiffness about 24 hours prior to MTX being due.  She does notice an increase in GI upset following administration of MTX.  She has not noted any increase in rashes, no infections. No hair loss. No bald spots.  She has been following with dermatology for her facial rash. Topical foam is helping.  AM stiffness lasting for about 2-3 hours  She does endorse ongoing pain in her feet. She has ongoing lower back pain.  She also complains of ongoing issues with her eyes, she is due for eye examination  Major concerns today include arthralgia, fatigue, joint pain and morning stiffness.

This office is committed to your overall well being. Regular psychiatric care is only a part of overall health and wellness. Please continue to work closely with your primary care physician for acute and chronic medical conditions, as these may be impacting your mood. Maintain a healthy weight- exercise regularly, as this also can improve mood and cognition. Keep a regular sleep schedule. Eat a nutritious diet, including plenty of fruits and vegetables. An easy rule of thumb is to keep it colorful (leafy greens, purple eggplant, red bell pepper, yellow squash). Stay hydrated by drinking water throughout the day, and limiting your intake of caffeine (this can worsen anxiety) and alcohol (this can affect sleep).  Please take medications as prescribed and do not make changes to your medications unless under the supervision of a physician. Often some medications may make you feel worse if doses are skipped, and some can be life threatening if abruptly stopped. Please let your provider know with adequate notice if you will need refills. If you experience intolerable side effects or worsening of condition, notify a health professional.  Please arrive early for all appointments, so that you can get checked in before your appointment time. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated so that we can remain on schedule and be respectful of your time. Please keep all scheduled appointments- frequent rescheduling negatively impacts your treatment. Please review our attendance policy and ask if you need clarification.  Note: myChart messages are not private communications between you and your provider and become part of your medical record. If you have concerns about your treatment plan, or feel that your medications are not working, please schedule to see your provider as it is difficult to address through email.   In case of emergency, call Novant Health Psychiatric Associates at 704-384-1246, Novant Health Presbyterian ACCESS at 704-384-4255, National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), Hopeline 1-800-235-4525, or 911; OR present to the nearest emergency room.

Assessment:  Jennifer Beth Cartrette is a 39 y.o. Caucasian female with presumed psoriatic arthritis  1. Presumed psoriatic arthritis: Active. With prior pain in the left wrist and right knee. She finds that prednisone does not help with this pain. Prior testing shows negative ANA, rheumatoid factor, CCP, HLA-B27, uric acid, ESR, CRP. She does have diffuse tenderness to palpation on exam today. She has found benefit from prednisone in the past   2. History of bulimia: With ongoing symptoms of decreased food intake.  She does take NSAIDs daily, but also finds that she has nausea daily and requires Zofran.   3.  History of degenerative disc disease in the cervical spine: With ongoing pain. Status post C4-C5, C5-C6 ACDF in September 2018. Daily Ibuprofen.   4.  Autoimmune thyroid disease: With positive thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase antibodies noted in 2018.  Recent testing does reveal abnormal thyroid function.  She is not currently on any thyroid medications. Plan:  Prior to prescribing any medications, she will need to complete necessary blood work  Check CBC, creatinine, hepatic function panel, ANA comprehensive panel, RF, CCP, CK, HLA-B27, CK, ESR, CRP, hepatitis panel, QuantiFERON gold  Once labs reviewed, we can proceed with consideration for hydroxychloroquine  As she and her significant other are considering pursuing pregnancy, teratogenic medications like leflunomide, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil will be avoided  She understands that I would not recommend prednisone long-term, though we may give a bridging course if hydroxychloroquine were to be pursued  She is aware that our office policy restricts my ability to prescribe nonrheumatic medications, and that I would defer management of such to her other providers  Food insecurity screening, depression screening, tobacco status updated in patient's chart   I encouraged her to continue to follow with her other providers as previously scheduled   Return to office in 3 months  I spent 30 minutes of face-to-face time with the patient and more than half of the time was devoted to patient education discussing about the importance of increasing physical activity; DMARD side effects; and current management plans.   Subjective:  Jennifer Beth Cartrette is a 39 y.o. female who is here for follow-up of presumed psoriatic arthritis. They were last evaluated in the Rheumatology Department in June 2020. At that time, she had lab work completed, and was started on Humira injections once every 14 days.  Since then, she has been lost to follow-up.  She reports taking Humira every 14 days for about 3 months. She stopped this due to having a number of other issues and stressors. She is not sure that Humira led to any improvement.

Please take medications as prescribed and do not make changes to your medications unless under the supervision of a physician. Often some medications may make you feel worse if doses are skipped, and some can be life threatening if abruptly stopped. Please let your provider know with adequate notice if you will need refills. If you experience intolerable side effects, notify this office.  Please arrive at least 15min early for all appointments, so that you can get checked in before your appointment time. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated so that we can remain on schedule and be respectful of your time. Please keep all scheduled appointments- frequent rescheduling negatively impacts your treatment. Please review our attendance policy and ask if you need clarification.  Note: myChart messages are not private communications between you and your provider and become part of your medical record. If you have concerns about your treatment plan, or feel that your medications are not working, please schedule to see your provider as it is difficult to address through email.

The skin protects the inside of the body from the outside world. When the skin is damaged or broken open, the wound can become infected or bleed. Cuts and scrapes are one type of wound. You may also hear these called abrasions. Scrapes on the surface leave deeper skin layers in place. These are often caused by friction or rubbing against a rough surface. Another kind is a puncture wound. This comes from something like a bite or stepping on a nail. Puncture wounds are caused by a pointed or sharp object, such as a nail, needle, or tooth entering the skin. Bleeding can be very little, and the wound may be barely obvious. Bites from a human or an animal always have germs in them and need extra care. A laceration is a cut on your skin. It is most often caused by a sharp object like a knife blade, glass, or from other things with sharp edges. If the cut is shallow, it does not need stitches.  What care is needed at home?  · Ask your doctor what you need to do when you go home. Make sure you ask questions if you do not understand what the doctor says. · Talk to your doctor about how to care for your wound. Ask your doctor about: ? When you should change your bandages. Your doctor may tell you to keep your wound covered to protect it from dirt and germs until it is fully healed. Use a telfa pad so it does not stick to the wound. Ask your doctor if you should use petroleum jelly or an antibiotic skin ointment. ? When you may take a bath or shower. Most often the doctor will tell you to keep your wound clean and dry for the first 24 hours. After 24 hours, you can gently wash the wound with soap and water or take a shower unless your doctor tells you to care for your wound differently. Do not take a tub bath or swim with an open wound. · Do not rub the wound or take off any small strips of tape. · Always wash your hands before and after touching the wound. · Each time you change the dressing, look closely at the wound to be sure it is healing the right way. The wound may have a yellowish discharge and this is normal. · Avoid picking the scab or scratching the site which may cause more irritation. What follow-up care is needed?  Your doctor may ask you to make visits to the office to check on your progress. Be sure to keep these visits. What drugs may be needed?  The doctor may order drugs to: · Help with pain · Prevent or fight an infection You may need to have a tetanus shot. Will physical activity be limited?  · Limit your activity until your wound is fully healed. Talk to your doctor about the right amount of activity for you. · Your doctor will tell you when it is safe to return to sports. Be sure to ask your doctor before you do any activities. What problems could happen?  · Bleeding · Infection · Scarring · Poor healing When do I need to call the doctor?  · Signs of infection. These include a fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher, chills, or wound that will not heal. · Signs of wound infection. These include swelling, redness, warmth around the wound; too much pain when touched; greenish or bloody discharge; foul smell coming from the wound; wound opens up. · If you think that there may be something in the wound that was not removed such as glass or a wood splinter Teach Back: Helping You Understand  The Teach Back Method helps you understand the information we are giving you. After you talk with the staff, tell them in your own words what you learned. This helps to make sure the staff has described each thing clearly. It also helps to explain things that may have been confusing. Before going home, make sure you can do these: · I can tell you about my wound. · I can tell you how to care for my wound. · I can tell you what I will do if I have swelling, redness, or warmth around my wound.

Please take medications as prescribed and do not make changes to your medications unless under the supervision of a physician. Often some medications may make you feel worse if doses are skipped, and some can be life threatening if abruptly stopped. Please let your provider know with adequate notice if you will need refills. If you experience intolerable side effects, notify this office.  Please arrive at least 15min early for all appointments, so that you can get checked in before your appointment time. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated so that we can remain on schedule and be respectful of your time. Please keep all scheduled appointments- frequent rescheduling negatively impacts your treatment. Please review our attendance policy and ask if you need clarification.  Note: myChart messages are not private communications between you and your provider and become part of your medical record. If you have concerns about your treatment plan, or feel that your medications are not working, please schedule to see your provider as it is difficult to address through email.
