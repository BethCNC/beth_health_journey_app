02/20/2018,8:02AM,Gina Licause, MD,,,"Hello!  Please forgive me, I did not give you as much information in my note to you as I should have.  I should have said that I suspect you have subclinical hyperthyroidism (early Hashimoto's is only 1 way this can happen).  Subclinical hyperthyroidism can sometimes lead to Graves disease (a cause for the eyes to sometimes become more prominent).  I do want you to proceed with the MRI ordered of the orbits and would like you to come in for one other thyroid blood test. If the MRI confirms Graves, then I would want you to see an endocrinologist (Dr Talip) to review how to proceed from there. If the MRI does not confirm Grave's disease, then you should get TSH and free T4 every 3 months for the next year. I will be happy to go ahead and make the referral to the orthopaedist and will do so.  Have a great rest of the week!  Dr. LiCause","Patient Portal Message"
