Please take medications as prescribed and do not make changes to your medications unless under the supervision of a physician.  Often some medications may make you feel worse if doses are skipped, and some can be life threatening if abruptly stopped.  Please let your provider know with adequate notice if you will need refills.  If you experience intolerable side effects, notify this office.

Please arrive at least 15min early for all appointments, so that you can get checked in before your appointment time.  Your cooperation is greatly appreciated so that we can remain on schedule and be respectful of your time.  Please keep all scheduled appointments- frequent rescheduling negatively impacts your treatment.  Please review our attendance policy and ask if you need clarification.

Note: myChart messages are not private communications between you and your provider and become part of your medical record.  If you have concerns about your treatment plan, or feel that your medications are not working, please schedule to see your provider as it is difficult to address through email.
