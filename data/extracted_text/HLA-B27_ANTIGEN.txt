Ms Cartrette,
I have reviewed your recent lab results. Your blood counts,
kidney function and liver function are all within normal ranges.
The testing we did looking for antibodies specific for conditions
like lupus, scleroderma, Sjogren's syndrome, inflammatory
muscle diseases were all normal. The test that can be seen
associated with psoriatic arthritis was also normal, but this does
not completely rule out this condition.
Your screening test for tuberculosis and hepatitis were both
negative.
The marker of inflammation that we checked was also improved.
If you would like to move forward with the pharmacy looking
into coverage options for Humira, please let me know and we
can start that process.
