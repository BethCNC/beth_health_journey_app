Comments From the Doctor's Office
Ms Cartrette,
I have reviewed your recent lab results. Your blood counts, kidney function and liver function are all
within normal ranges.
The testing we did looking for antibodies specific for conditions like lupus, scleroderma, Sjogren's
syndrome, inflammatory muscle diseases were all normal. The test that can be seen associated
with psoriatic arthritis was also normal, but this does not completely rule out this condition.
Your screening test for tuberculosis and hepatitis were both negative.
The marker of inflammation that we checked was also improved.
If you would like to move forward with the pharmacy looking into coverage options for Humira,
please let me know and we can start that process.
