The results of your recent blood work are included below. Most
of your lab results look excellent and are normal at this time.
1. Thyroid antibody slightly elevated consistent with likely
Hashimoto's. TSH and free T4 were normal.
2. Labs overall unremarkable
Please follow-up in clinic as we discussed at the time of your
