QuantiFERON Criteria: Comment
I have reviewed your recent lab results.
 
Your blood counts, kidney function and liver function are all within normal ranges.
 
The testing we did looking for antibodies and markers assessed with conditions like systemic lupus
erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, scleroderma, inﬂammatory muscle
diseases, psoriatic arthritis all came back normal.  Both markers of inﬂammation were within normal
ranges.
 
Because of these normal lab results, starting a stronger immune suppressing medication would not
be recommended.  We could consider starting a medication such as hydroxychloroquine to monitor
your response.  This is a medication that is not an immune suppressing medication, but is a
medication that can take a number of months to build up in your system and take effect.  You can
read more about medications website below.

Please let me know if you have any questions about this medication, or if you feel comfortable with
me sending a prescription to your local pharmacy.
