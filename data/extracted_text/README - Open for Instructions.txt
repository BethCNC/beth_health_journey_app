Notes:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When you download your health or visit summary documents, several files are compressed into a single ZIP file so they can
be transferred quickly. You need to uncompress (unzip) this file before you can view your documents. Refer to steps below 
for uncompressing your download. A PDF file was included with your download and provides the easiest way to view the
contents of this document. Your download also includes files in the IHE_XDM folder with names starting with 'DOC'. 
These files let other healthcare software applications understand the data in the documents. If you chose to encrypt your
download, it will only remain encrypted until you unzip it. To continue protecting your data when you are done viewing
it, locate the unzipped folder and delete it.
