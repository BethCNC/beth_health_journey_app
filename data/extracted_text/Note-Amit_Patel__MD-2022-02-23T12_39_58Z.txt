 
Assessment:
Jennifer Beth Cartrette is a 39 y.o. Caucasian female with presumed psoriatic arthritis

1.  Presumed psoriatic arthritis: Active. With prior pain in the left wrist and right knee.  She finds that prednisone does not help with this pain.  Prior testing shows negative ANA, rheumatoid factor, CCP, HLA-B27, uric acid, ESR, CRP.  She does have diffuse tenderness to palpation on exam today.    She has found benefit from prednisone in the past
 
2. History of bulimia: With ongoing symptoms of decreased food intake.  She does take NSAIDs daily, but also finds that she has nausea daily and requires Zofran.
 
3.  History of degenerative disc disease in the cervical spine: With ongoing pain. Status post C4-C5, C5-C6 ACDF in September 2018. Daily Ibuprofen.
 
4.  Autoimmune thyroid disease: With positive thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase antibodies noted in 2018.  Recent testing does reveal abnormal thyroid function.  She is not currently on any thyroid medications.
Plan:
Prior to prescribing any medications, she will need to complete necessary blood work

Check CBC, creatinine, hepatic function panel, ANA comprehensive panel, RF, CCP, CK, HLA-B27, CK, ESR, CRP, hepatitis panel, QuantiFERON gold

Once labs reviewed, we can proceed with consideration for hydroxychloroquine

As she and her significant other are considering pursuing pregnancy, teratogenic medications like leflunomide, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil will be avoided

She understands that I would not recommend prednisone long-term, though we may give a bridging course if hydroxychloroquine were to be pursued

She is aware that our office policy restricts my ability to prescribe nonrheumatic medications, and that I would defer management of such to her other providers

Food insecurity screening, depression screening, tobacco status updated in patient's chart
 
I encouraged her to continue to follow with her other providers as previously scheduled
 
Return to office in 3 months

I spent 30 minutes of face-to-face time with the patient and more than half of the time was devoted to patient education discussing about the importance of increasing physical activity; DMARD side effects; and current management plans. 

Subjective:
Jennifer Beth Cartrette is a 39 y.o. female who is here for follow-up of presumed psoriatic arthritis.  They were last evaluated in the Rheumatology Department in June 2020. At that time, she had lab work completed, and was started on Humira injections once every 14 days.

Since then, she has been lost to follow-up.

She reports taking Humira every 14 days for about 3 months.  She stopped this due to having a number of other issues and stressors.  She is not sure that Humira led to any improvement.

She does feel that her symptoms have worsened since her last appointment.

She endorses symptoms of hot flushes, nausea, fatigue, diffuse pain.  She finds that any movements and stress aggravate nausea.  This is what limits her daily activities.

She does endorse about 2 hours of feeling nauseated and dizzy in the AM when she gets up in the bed.  She does describe stiffness in her fingers, anterior chest, spine.  This is worse in the AM, lasting for about 2 hours.  She attributes anterior chest pain to congestion and nonproductive cough.  She does feel that pain is a driver causing nausea.

She does feel that ibuprofen helps with swelling in her hands, knees, shoulders, etc.

She continues to have rashes on her face, which has been diagnosed as a staphylococcus infection.  

She admits to blood in her stool, which she relates to constipation.  She does endorse constipation.  She admits to having a bowel movement rarely, once every 2 weeks.
