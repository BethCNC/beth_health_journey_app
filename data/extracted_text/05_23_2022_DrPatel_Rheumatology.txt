Assessment:
Jennifer
Beth
Cartrette
is
a
37
y.o.
Caucasian
female
with
polyarthralgia
1.
Polyarthralgia:
With
pain
in
the
left
wrist
and
right
knee.
She
finds
that
prednisone
does
not
help
with
this
pain.
Prior
testing
shows
negative
ANA,
rheumatoid
factor,
CCP,
uric
acid.
She
does
have
tenderness
to
palpation
on
exam
today.
Testing
that
was
ordered
in
March
2020
has
yet
been
resulted.
2.
History
of
bulimia:
With
ongoing
symptoms
of
decreased
food
intake.
She
does
take
NSAIDs
daily,
but
also
finds
that
she
has
nausea
daily
and
requires
Zofran.
3.
History
of
degenerative
disc
disease
in
the
cervical
spine:
Status
post
C4-C5,
C5-C6
ACDF
in
September
2018.
Continues
to
follow
with
orthopedics.
Daily
Aleve.
4.
Autoimmune
thyroid
disease:
With
positive
thyroglobulin
and
thyroid
peroxidase
antibodies
noted
in
2018.
Recent
testing
does
reveal
abnormal
thyroid
function.
She
is
not
currently
on
any
thyroid
medications.
Plan:
We
will
await
her
lab
results,
and
once
they
are
reviewed,
we
will
consider
starting
Humira
injections
every
7
days
She
will
continue
on
steroids,
will
transition
to
Rayos
5
mg
at
night
(samples
provided
today)
She
will
also
use
Vimovo,
if
covered
by
her
insurance
(she
is
aware
if
it
is
not
covered,
she
will
return
to
using
Aleve)
She
is
aware
that
our
office
does
not
have
capabilities
to
ultrasound
with
our
joint
aspirations,
so
she
elects
to
follow
with
orthopedics
whenever
joint
aspirations
are
required
She
is
aware
that
our
office
policy
restricts
my
ability
to
prescribe
nonrheumatic
medications,
and
that
I
would
defer
management
of
such
to
her
other
providers
I
encouraged
her
to
continue
to
follow
with
her
other
providers
as
previously
scheduled
Return
to
office
in
3
months
To
assess
for
drug
toxicity
continue
monitoring
blood
tests
once
every
6
months
.
I
spent
20
minutes
of
face-to-face
time
with
the
patient
and
more
than
half
of
the
time
was
devoted
to
patient
education
discussing
about
the
importance
of
increasing
physical
activity;
medication
side
effects;
and
current
management
plans.
