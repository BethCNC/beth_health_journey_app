Hello Jennifer Beth Cartrette
Your pap smear results have returned. There were some
questionable cells (termed "abnormal cells of undetermined
significance"). When we get this result, we have the lab test for
the HPV virus, which causes almost all precancerous cellular
abnormalities. This result was negative. That combination of
results is very reassuring and based on current national
guidelines, I recommend repeating the pap smear in three years
BUT still have once yearly GYN visit and exam. Please let us know
if you have any questions.
