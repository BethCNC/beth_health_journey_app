HPI
History
of
Present
Illness
The
patient
presents
for
evaluation
of
multiple
medical
concerns.
She
does
not
need
an
Adderall
refill
currently.
She
had
a
3-hour
meeting
with
her
patient
advocate,
who
suspects
Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome.
She
is
considering
genetic
testing
and
treatment
options
for
Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome.
She
has
experienced
nausea
for
5-6
years
and
has
a
history
of
bulimia
with
daily
vomiting
for
30
years.
She
also
reports
chest
pain
since
2017
and
seeks
definitive
answers.
She
has
knee
inflammation,
starting
with
the
right
knee
4-5
years
ago,
now
affecting
the
left
knee.
She
stopped
methotrexate
and
is
considering
more
specialists.
She
uses
compression
and
ice,
which
helps.
She
avoids
movement
to
prevent
symptom
exacerbation.
She
has
felt
unwell
for
3
months
with
shoulder
and
arm
issues
and
is
concerned
about
needing
another
back
surgery
due
to
an
unstable
spine.
She
reports
new
tinnitus,
described
as
ocean-like,
possibly
related
to
blood
pressure.
She
also
experiences
brain
fog
and
mental
exhaustion,
attributing
it
to
a
lack
of
oxygen.
She
is
out
of
Adderall
and
feels
her
brain
is
not
functioning
properly.
She
seeks
an
autism
assessment
and
deals
with
sensory
issues.
