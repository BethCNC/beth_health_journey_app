Nerve conduction studies of select motor and sensory nerves were performed in the right upper limb. For

full results, please refer to the tabulated forms enclosed.

The median and ulnar motor studies

demonstrate normal distal latencies, amplitudes and conduction velocities. For the ulnar nerve, there is

eduction across the elbow. The median and ulnar

no significant nerve conduction slowing or amplitude re

sensory distal latencies and amplitudes are also normal

EMG needle examination of select muscles in the right
performed in the standard fashion. For full results, ple

upper limb and cervical paraspinals was also
ase refer to the tabulated forms enclosed. Briefly,

all muscles tested reveal normal insertional activity with no evidence of muscle membrane irritability in
the form of positive sharp waves or fibrillation potentials. All muscles sampled reveal voluntary motor

unit action potentials which are normal in number, appe
paraspinals, insertional activity is normal at all levels e
evident at any level.

IMPRESSION:

1) Normal study.
2) There is no electrodiagnostic evidence of a cervical
neuropathy involving the right upper limb.
