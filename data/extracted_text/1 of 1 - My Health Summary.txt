Narrative
05/08/2018 11:21 AM EDT
HISTORY: Pain.
COMPARISONS: X-rays dated 2/14/2018.
PROCEDURE: Informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the fluoroscopy table. The
skin anterior to the right shoulder was marked and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
Following adequate local anesthesia with 1%
Xylocaine, a 22-gauge spinal needle was introduced into the glenohumeral joint. Permanent image was
obtained with the needle in the joint. Following administration of Xylocaine, approximately 12-15 cc of
dilute gadolinium (0.1 cc of gadolinium mixed with
Xylocaine and contrast) was injected during intermittent fluoroscopic observation. The needle was removed
and hemostasis was achieved. The patient tolerated the procedure well without apparent complication.
FLUORO TIME: 18 seconds.
NUMBER OF IMAGES: 4 fluoroscopic images.
INTERPRETATION: Contrast injected into the glenohumeral joint remains within the glenohumeral joint
without evidence of extravasation to suggest full thickness rotator cuff tear.

FINDINGS:
ROTATOR CUFF: No full-thickness rotator cuff tear is identified. No partial-thickness tear is visualized.
There is some minimal edema signal which infiltrates the posterior margin of the infraspinatus muscle,
suspicious for a strain. No drainable fluid
collection is present. No rotator cuff muscle atrophy is present.
GLENOHUMERAL JOINT: There are no definitive lesions of the bony glenoid or cartilaginous labrum.
LONG HEAD BICEPS TENDON: The tendon is intact and located in its normal anatomic position.
ACROMIOCLAVICULAR JOINT: The acromioclavicular joint is well-preserved. Note is made of a type 2
acromion.

The Pap smear is a screening test designed to aid in the detection of
premalignant and malignant conditions of the uterine cervix. It is not a
diagnostic procedure and should not be used as the sole means of detecting
cervical cancer. Both false-positive and false-negative reports do occur.

Impressions
IMPRESSION: Orbital asymmetry as described. No definite orbital mass lesion on the right. Question mild
old medial orbital wall injury on the left. Left sphenoethmoidal opacification also noted.

Narrative
02/25/2018 8:16 PM EST
HISTORY: Proptosis.
COMPARISON: None.
Multisequence, multiplanar images were performed on a high field MRI through the orbits before and after
the uneventful ministration of 6 cc Gadavist IV.
There is slight orbital asymmetry with the right globe protruding further than the left. I see no intra
or extraconal mass lesion to account for this, and the orbital fat is preserved. The extraocular muscles
are unremarkable. Slight asymmetric inward
bowing of the left medial orbital wall suggests a possible remote left orbital injury. There is also
opacification of a left posterior ethmoid cell with opacification of adjacent portions of a septated left
sphenoid cell. Mild mucosal thickening is seen
elsewhere within the ethmoids. No fluid level.
The visualized intracranial structures are unremarkable.

The Pap smear is a screening test designed to aid in the detection of
premalignant and malignant conditions of the uterine cervix. It is not a
diagnostic procedure and should not be used as the sole means of detecting
cervical cancer. Both false-positive and false-negative reports do occur.

Narrative
MRI CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST
TECHNIQUE: Multiple T1 and T2 weighted MR images were obtained
PROVIDED CLINICAL INFORMATION: M50.322-Other cervical disc degeneration at C5-C6 level Right C6
radiculopathy with wrist extensor and shoulder girdle weakness on exam
ADDITIONAL CLINICAL INFORMATION: None available
COMPARISON: Radiograph 6/5/2018.
INTERPRETATION:
There is mild reversal of normal lordosis, but no focal malalignment. There is no fracture or marrow
replacing process. Posterior elements are intact. The odontoid and C1-C2 relationship is normal. Cervical
medullary junction is normal. The spinal cord
is normal size and signal intensity. The paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable.
C1-2: No abnormality.
C2-3: No significant central canal or foraminal stenosis.
C3-4: No significant central canal or foraminal stenosis.
C4-5: There is shallow right paramedian disc protrusion with annular fissuring effacing the right ventral
thecal sac and ventral spinal cord surface. There is mild degree of canal stenosis. The cord is not
displaced posteriorly or impinged. There is no
foraminal stenosis.
C5-6: There is moderate disc space narrowing with posterior lateral marginal osteophyte/disc complex with
right greater than left uncovertebral joint osteophyte. There is effacement of the ventral aspect of the
thecal sac. There is contacted, but no
effacement of the ventral cord surface. There is mild degree of canal stenosis. There is moderate right,
but no left foraminal stenosis.
C6-7: No significant central canal or foraminal stenosis.
C7-T1: No significant central canal or foraminal stenosis.

PROVIDED CLINICAL INFORMATION: M50.322-Other cervical disc degeneration at C5-C6 level Right C6 radiculopathy with wrist
extensor and shoulder girdle weakness on exam
ADDITIONAL CLINICAL INFORMATION: None available
COMPARISON: Radiograph 6/5/2018.
INTERPRETATION:
There is mild reversal of normal lordosis, but no focal malalignment. There is no fracture or marrow replacing process. Posterior
elements are intact. The odontoid and C1-C2 relationship is normal. Cervical medullary junction is normal. The spinal cord
is normal size and signal intensity. The paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable.
C1-2: No abnormality.
C2-3: No significant central canal or foraminal stenosis.
C3-4: No significant central canal or foraminal stenosis.
C4-5: There is shallow right paramedian disc protrusion with annular fissuring effacing the right ventral thecal sac and ventral
spinal cord surface. There is mild degree of canal stenosis. The cord is not displaced posteriorly or impinged. There is no
foraminal stenosis.
C5-6: There is moderate disc space narrowing with posterior lateral marginal osteophyte/disc complex with right greater than left
uncovertebral joint osteophyte. There is effacement of the ventral aspect of the thecal sac. There is contacted, but no
effacement of the ventral cord surface. There is mild degree of canal stenosis. There is moderate right, but no left foraminal
stenosis.
C6-7: No significant central canal or foraminal stenosis.
C7-T1: No significant central canal or foraminal stenosis.
There is no significant stenosis at the visualized upper thoracic disc spaces.

IMPRESSION:
1. Shallow right paramedian disc protrusion with annular fissuring at C4-5 causing mass effect on right ventral cord surface. There
is mild degree of canal stenosis. No foraminal stenosis.
2. Posterior lateral marginal osteophyte and right uncovertebral joint osteophyte at C5-6 with contact, but no deformity of the
ventral cord surface. There is mild canal stenosis with moderate right, but no left foraminal stenosis.

Narrative
05/08/2018 11:21 AM EDT
HISTORY: Pain.
COMPARISONS: X-rays dated 2/14/2018.
PROCEDURE: Informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the fluoroscopy table. The
skin anterior to the right shoulder was marked and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
Following adequate local anesthesia with 1%
Xylocaine, a 22-gauge spinal needle was introduced into the glenohumeral joint. Permanent image was
obtained with the needle in the joint. Following administration of Xylocaine, approximately 12-15 cc of
dilute gadolinium (0.1 cc of gadolinium mixed with
Xylocaine and contrast) was injected during intermittent fluoroscopic observation. The needle was removed
and hemostasis was achieved. The patient tolerated the procedure well without apparent complication.
FLUORO TIME: 18 seconds.
NUMBER OF IMAGES: 4 fluoroscopic images.
INTERPRETATION: Contrast injected into the glenohumeral joint remains within the glenohumeral joint
without evidence of extravasation to suggest full thickness rotator cuff tear.

The Pap smear is a screening test designed to aid in the detection of
premalignant and malignant conditions of the uterine cervix. It is not a
diagnostic procedure and should not be used as the sole means of detecting
cervical cancer. Both false-positive and false-negative reports do occur.

IMPRESSION: Orbital asymmetry as described. No definite orbital mass lesion on the right. Question mild
old medial orbital wall injury on the left. Left sphenoethmoidal opacification also noted.

Narrative
02/25/2018 8:16 PM EST
HISTORY: Proptosis.
COMPARISON: None.
Multisequence, multiplanar images were performed on a high field MRI through the orbits before and after
the uneventful ministration of 6 cc Gadavist IV.
There is slight orbital asymmetry with the right globe protruding further than the left. I see no intra
or extraconal mass lesion to account for this, and the orbital fat is preserved. The extraocular muscles
are unremarkable. Slight asymmetric inward
bowing of the left medial orbital wall suggests a possible remote left orbital injury. There is also
opacification of a left posterior ethmoid cell with opacification of adjacent portions of a septated left
sphenoid cell. Mild mucosal thickening is seen
elsewhere within the ethmoids. No fluid level.
The visualized intracranial structures are unremarkable.

The Pap smear is a screening test designed to aid in the detection of
premalignant and malignant conditions of the uterine cervix. It is not a
diagnostic procedure and should not be used as the sole means of detecting
cervical cancer. Both false-positive and false-negative reports do occur.

Progress Notes - documented in this encounter
Amit Patel, MD - 09/27/2022 3:40 PM EDT
Formatting of this note is different from the original.

Assessment:
Jennifer Beth Cartrette is a 40 y.o. Caucasian female with presumed psoriatic arthritis
1. Presumed psoriatic arthritis: Ongoing symptoms. With prior pain in the left wrist and right knee. She finds that prednisone does
not help with this pain. Prior testing shows negative ANA, rheumatoid factor, CCP, HLA-B27, uric acid, ESR, CRP. HCQ started
3/2022, discontinued in 5/2022 due to ringing in the ears. MTX started in May 2022. She has found benefit from prednisone in the
past
2. Use of high-risk medications: Methotrexate, due for labs, no serious infections or hospitalizations..
3. History of bulimia: With ongoing symptoms of decreased food intake. She does take NSAIDs daily, but also finds that she has
nausea daily and requires Zofran.
4. History of degenerative disc disease in the cervical spine: With ongoing pain. Status post C4-C5, C5-C6 ACDF in September 2018.

Daily Ibuprofen.
5. Autoimmune thyroid disease: With positive thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase antibodies noted in 2018. Recent testing does
reveal abnormal thyroid function. She is not currently on any thyroid medications.
Plan:
Continue methotrexate 10mg by mouth weekly with daily folic acid
Check CBC, creatinine, hepatic function panel
Consider increasing MTX to 15mg PO weekly vs adding Otezla vs Cosentyx
She is aware that our office policy restricts my ability to prescribe nonrheumatic medications, and that I would defer management
of such to her other providers
I encouraged her to continue to follow with her other providers as previously scheduled
Return to office in 4 months
To assess for drug toxicity continue monitoring blood tests once every 12 weeks .
I spent 25 minutes of face-to-face time with the patient and more than half of the time was devoted to patient education
discussing about the importance of increasing physical activity; DMARD side effects; and current management plans.

Subjective:
Jennifer Beth Cartrette is a 40 y.o. female who is here for follow-up of psoriatic arthritis. They were last evaluated in the
Rheumatology Department in May 2022. At that time, she was to start methotrexate 10 mg by mouth weekly with daily folic acid
Since then, she has not noted significant benefit, but she has noted increase in stress and overuse of her joints, which has worsened
her symptoms.
She does feel that she has had less swelling, but she can notice an increase in stiffness about 24 hours prior to MTX being due.
She does notice an increase in GI upset following administration of MTX.
She has not noted any increase in rashes, no infections. No hair loss. No bald spots.
She has been following with dermatology for her facial rash. Topical foam is helping.
AM stiffness lasting for about 2-3 hours
She does endorse ongoing pain in her feet. She has ongoing lower back pain.
She also complains of ongoing issues with her eyes, she is due for eye examination
Major concerns today include arthralgia, fatigue, joint pain and morning stiffness. Over the past one week the symptom (s) is (are)
moderate. Jennifer Beth Cartrette reports symptom severity rating of 4 on a scale of 0 to 10.
Patient thinks that symptoms are helped by Methotrexate - Problems: none. Associated symptoms include: arthralgia, fatigue, joint
pain and morning stiffness. Patient denies shortness of breath, cough, leg edema, alopecia, bleeding/clotting problems, depression,

Patient Instructions
Allison Dejarnatt, NP - 09/06/2022 9:05 AM EDT
Formatting of this note might be different from the original.
This office is committed to your overall well being. Regular psychiatric care is only a part of overall health and wellness. Please
continue to work closely with your primary care physician for acute and chronic medical conditions, as these may be impacting
your mood. Maintain a healthy weight- exercise regularly, as this also can improve mood and cognition. Keep a regular sleep
schedule. Eat a nutritious diet, including plenty of fruits and vegetables. An easy rule of thumb is to keep it colorful (leafy greens,
purple eggplant, red bell pepper, yellow squash). Stay hydrated by drinking water throughout the day, and limiting your intake of
caffeine (this can worsen anxiety) and alcohol (this can affect sleep).
Please take medications as prescribed and do not make changes to your medications unless under the supervision of a physician.
Often some medications may make you feel worse if doses are skipped, and some can be life threatening if abruptly stopped.
Please let your provider know with adequate notice if you will need refills. If you experience intolerable side effects or worsening of
condition, notify a health professional.
Please arrive early for all appointments, so that you can get checked in before your appointment time. Your cooperation is greatly
appreciated so that we can remain on schedule and be respectful of your time. Please keep all scheduled appointments- frequent
rescheduling negatively impacts your treatment. Please review our attendance policy and ask if you need clarification.
Note: myChart messages are not private communications between you and your provider and become part of your medical record.
If you have concerns about your treatment plan, or feel that your medications are not working, please schedule to see your
provider as it is difficult to address through email.
In case of emergency, call Novant Health Psychiatric Associates at 704-384-1246, Novant Health Presbyterian ACCESS at
704-384-4255, National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), Hopeline 1-800-235-4525, or 911; OR present to the
nearest emergency room.

1. Presumed psoriatic arthritis: Ongoing symptoms. With prior pain in the left wrist and right knee. She finds that prednisone does
not help with this pain. Prior testing shows negative ANA, rheumatoid factor, CCP, HLA-B27, uric acid, ESR, CRP. HCQ started
3/2022, discontinued in 5/2022 due to ringing in the ears. She does have diffuse tenderness to palpation on exam today. She has
found benefit from prednisone in the past
2. Use of high-risk medications: Hydroxychloroquine, no vision deficits. Baseline eye exam not yet completed.
3. History of bulimia: With ongoing symptoms of decreased food intake. She does take NSAIDs daily, but also finds that she has

Plan:
Remain off of HCQ given tinnitus
Start MTX 10mg PO weekly with daily folic acid
Check CBC, Cr, HFP in 4 weeks
She is aware that our office policy restricts my ability to prescribe nonrheumatic medications, and that I would defer management
of such to her other providers
Food insecurity screening, depression screening, tobacco status updated in patient's chart
I encouraged her to continue to follow with her other providers as previously scheduled
Return to office in 4 months
To assess for drug toxicity continue monitoring blood tests once every 6 months .
I spent 25 minutes of face-to-face time with the patient and more than half of the time was devoted to patient education
discussing about the importance of increasing physical activity; DMARD side effects; and current management plans.

Progress Notes - documented in this encounter
Amit Patel, MD - 02/23/2022 1:20 PM EST
Formatting of this note is different from the original.

Assessment:
Jennifer Beth Cartrette is a 39 y.o. Caucasian female with presumed psoriatic arthritis
1. Presumed psoriatic arthritis: Active. With prior pain in the left wrist and right knee. She finds that prednisone does not help with
this pain. Prior testing shows negative ANA, rheumatoid factor, CCP, HLA-B27, uric acid, ESR, CRP. She does have diffuse tenderness
to palpation on exam today. She has found benefit from prednisone in the past
2. History of bulimia: With ongoing symptoms of decreased food intake. She does take NSAIDs daily, but also finds that she has
nausea daily and requires Zofran.
3. History of degenerative disc disease in the cervical spine: With ongoing pain. Status post C4-C5, C5-C6 ACDF in September
2018. Daily Ibuprofen.

4. Autoimmune thyroid disease: With positive thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase antibodies noted in 2018. Recent testing does
reveal abnormal thyroid function. She is not currently on any thyroid medications.
Plan:
Prior to prescribing any medications, she will need to complete necessary blood work
Check CBC, creatinine, hepatic function panel, ANA comprehensive panel, RF, CCP, CK, HLA-B27, CK, ESR, CRP, hepatitis panel,
QuantiFERON gold
Once labs reviewed, we can proceed with consideration for hydroxychloroquine
As she and her significant other are considering pursuing pregnancy, teratogenic medications like leflunomide, methotrexate,
mycophenolate mofetil will be avoided
She understands that I would not recommend prednisone long-term, though we may give a bridging course if hydroxychloroquine
were to be pursued
She is aware that our office policy restricts my ability to prescribe nonrheumatic medications, and that I would defer management
of such to her other providers
Food insecurity screening, depression screening, tobacco status updated in patient's chart
I encouraged her to continue to follow with her other providers as previously scheduled
Return to office in 3 months
I spent 30 minutes of face-to-face time with the patient and more than half of the time was devoted to patient education
discussing about the importance of increasing physical activity; DMARD side effects; and current management plans.
Subjective:
Jennifer Beth Cartrette is a 39 y.o. female who is here for follow-up of presumed psoriatic arthritis. They were last evaluated in the
Rheumatology Department in June 2020. At that time, she had lab work completed, and was started on Humira injections once
every 14 days.
Since then, she has been lost to follow-up.
She reports taking Humira every 14 days for about 3 months. She stopped this due to having a number of other issues and
stressors. She is not sure that Humira led to any improvement.
She does feel that her symptoms have worsened since her last appointment.
She endorses symptoms of hot flushes, nausea, fatigue, diffuse pain. She finds that any movements and stress aggravate nausea.
This is what limits her daily activities.
She does endorse about 2 hours of feeling nauseated and dizzy in the AM when she gets up in the bed. She does describe stiffness
in her fingers, anterior chest, spine. This is worse in the AM, lasting for about 2 hours. She attributes anterior chest pain to
congestion and nonproductive cough. She does feel that pain is a driver causing nausea.
She does feel that ibuprofen helps with swelling in her hands, knees, shoulders, etc.
She continues to have rashes on her face, which has been diagnosed as a staphylococcus infection.
She admits to blood in her stool, which she relates to constipation. She does endorse constipation. She admits to having a bowel
movement rarely, once every 2 weeks.
Major concerns today include arthralgia, fatigue, joint pain, morning stiffness and nausea. Over the past one week the symptom (s)
is (are) moderate and severe. Jennifer Beth Cartrette reports symptom severity rating of 10 on a scale of 0 to 10.
Patient thinks that symptoms are helped by none. Associated symptoms include: arthralgia, fatigue, joint pain, morning stiffness
and nausea. Patient denies shortness of breath, cough, leg edema, alopecia, bleeding/clotting problems, depression, fevers,
memory loss, muscle weakness, new headache, nodules, oral ulcers, palpitations, polydypsia, polyuria and seizures.

Patient Instructions
Suja Raju, MD - 06/10/2021 10:47 AM EDT
Formatting of this note might be different from the original.
Please take medications as prescribed and do not make changes to your medications unless under the supervision of a physician.
Often some medications may make you feel worse if doses are skipped, and some can be life threatening if abruptly stopped.
Please let your provider know with adequate notice if you will need refills. If you experience intolerable side effects, notify this
office.
Please arrive at least 15min early for all appointments, so that you can get checked in before your appointment time. Your
cooperation is greatly appreciated so that we can remain on schedule and be respectful of your time. Please keep all scheduled
appointments- frequent rescheduling negatively impacts your treatment. Please review our attendance policy and ask if you need
clarification.
Note: myChart messages are not private communications between you and your provider and become part of your medical record.

Patient Education
Wound Care Discharge Instructions
About this topic
A wound is an injury to the skin that “breaks” the barrier to the outside. The skin protects the inside of the body from the outside
world. When the skin is damaged or broken open, the wound can become infected or bleed.
Cuts and scrapes are one type of wound. You may also hear these called abrasions. Scrapes on the surface leave deeper skin layers
in place. These are often caused by friction or rubbing against a rough surface.
Another kind is a puncture wound. This comes from something like a bite or stepping on a nail. Puncture wounds are caused by a
pointed or sharp object, such as a nail, needle, or tooth entering the skin. Bleeding can be very little, and the wound may be barely
obvious. Bites from a human or an animal always have germs in them and need extra care.

A laceration is a cut on your skin. It is most often caused by a sharp object like a knife blade, glass, or from other things with sharp
edges. If the cut is shallow, it does not need stitches.
What care is needed at home?
· Ask your doctor what you need to do when you go home. Make sure you ask questions if you do not understand what the doctor
says.
· Talk to your doctor about how to care for your wound. Ask your doctor about:
? When you should change your bandages. Your doctor may tell you to keep your wound covered to protect it from dirt and germs
until it is fully healed. Use a telfa pad so it does not stick to the wound. Ask your doctor if you should use petroleum jelly or an
antibiotic skin ointment.
? When you may take a bath or shower. Most often the doctor will tell you to keep your wound clean and dry for the first 24 hours.
After 24 hours, you can gently wash the wound with soap and water or take a shower unless your doctor tells you to care for your
wound differently. Do not take a tub bath or swim with an open wound.
· Do not rub the wound or take off any small strips of tape.
· Always wash your hands before and after touching the wound.
· Each time you change the dressing, look closely at the wound to be sure it is healing the right way. The wound may have a
yellowish discharge and this is normal.
· Avoid picking the scab or scratching the site which may cause more irritation.
What follow-up care is needed?
Your doctor may ask you to make visits to the office to check on your progress. Be sure to keep these visits.
What drugs may be needed?
The doctor may order drugs to:
· Help with pain
· Prevent or fight an infection
You may need to have a tetanus shot.
Will physical activity be limited?
· Limit your activity until your wound is fully healed. Talk to your doctor about the right amount of activity for you.
· Your doctor will tell you when it is safe to return to sports. Be sure to ask your doctor before you do any activities.
What problems could happen?
· Bleeding
· Infection
· Scarring
· Poor healing
When do I need to call the doctor?
· Signs of infection. These include a fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher, chills, or wound that will not heal.
· Signs of wound infection. These include swelling, redness, warmth around the wound; too much pain when touched; greenish or
bloody discharge; foul smell coming from the wound; wound opens up.
· If you think that there may be something in the wound that was not removed such as glass or a wood splinter
Teach Back: Helping You Understand
The Teach Back Method helps you understand the information we are giving you. After you talk with the staff, tell them in your own
words what you learned. This helps to make sure the staff has described each thing clearly. It also helps to explain things that may
have been confusing. Before going home, make sure you can do these:
· I can tell you about my wound.
· I can tell you how to care for my wound.
· I can tell you what I will do if I have swelling, redness, or warmth around my wound.

Patient Instructions
Suja Raju, MD - 12/22/2020 10:52 AM EST
Formatting of this note might be different from the original.
Please take medications as prescribed and do not make changes to your medications unless under the supervision of a physician.
Often some medications may make you feel worse if doses are skipped, and some can be life threatening if abruptly stopped.
Please let your provider know with adequate notice if you will need refills. If you experience intolerable side effects, notify this
office.
Please arrive at least 15min early for all appointments, so that you can get checked in before your appointment time. Your
cooperation is greatly appreciated so that we can remain on schedule and be respectful of your time. Please keep all scheduled
appointments- frequent rescheduling negatively impacts your treatment. Please review our attendance policy and ask if you need

Progress Notes - documented in this encounter
Amit Patel, MD - 06/23/2020 9:40 AM EDT
Formatting of this note is different from the original.

Assessment:
Jennifer Beth Cartrette is a 37 y.o. Caucasian female with polyarthralgia
1. Polyarthralgia: With pain in the left wrist and right knee. She finds that prednisone does not help with this pain. Prior testing
shows negative ANA, rheumatoid factor, CCP, uric acid. She does have tenderness to palpation on exam today. Testing that was
ordered in March 2020 has yet been resulted.
2. History of bulimia: With ongoing symptoms of decreased food intake. She does take NSAIDs daily, but also finds that she has
nausea daily and requires Zofran.
3. History of degenerative disc disease in the cervical spine: Status post C4-C5, C5-C6 ACDF in September 2018. Continues to
follow with orthopedics. Daily Aleve.
4. Autoimmune thyroid disease: With positive thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase antibodies noted in 2018. Recent testing does
reveal abnormal thyroid function. She is not currently on any thyroid medications.
Plan:
We will await her lab results, and once they are reviewed, we will consider starting Humira injections every 7 days
She will continue on steroids, will transition to Rayos 5 mg at night (samples provided today)
She will also use Vimovo, if covered by her insurance (she is aware if it is not covered, she will return to using Aleve)
She is aware that our office does not have capabilities to ultrasound with our joint aspirations, so she elects to follow with
orthopedics whenever joint aspirations are required
She is aware that our office policy restricts my ability to prescribe nonrheumatic medications, and that I would defer management
of such to her other providers
I encouraged her to continue to follow with her other providers as previously scheduled
Return to office in 3 months
To assess for drug toxicity continue monitoring blood tests once every 6 months .
I spent 20 minutes of face-to-face time with the patient and more than half of the time was devoted to patient education
discussing about the importance of increasing physical activity; medication side effects; and current management plans.

Subjective:
Jennifer Beth Cartrette is a 37 y.o. female who is here for follow-up of polyarthralgia. They were last evaluated in the Rheumatology

She has noted that prednisone helps with swelling in her knee and pain in her knee and wrist.
AM stiffness lasting for about 30 minutes when off of prednisone, less when on prednisone.
No new rashes.
She is still being treated for a Staph infection on her face.

No enthesitis. She has noted swelling in her fingers from time to time.

office.
Please arrive at least 15min early for all appointments, so that you can get checked in before your appointment time. Your
