IMPRESSION:
1. Shallow right paramedian disc protrusion with annular fissuring at C4-5 causing mass effect
on right ventral cord surface. There is mild degree of canal stenosis. No foraminal stenosis.
2. Posterior lateral marginal osteophyte and right uncovertebral joint osteophyte at C5-6 with
contact, but no deformity of the ventral cord surface. There is mild canal stenosis with
moderate right, but no left foraminal stenosis.

Narrative
MRI CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST
TECHNIQUE: Multiple T1 and T2 weighted MR images were obtained
PROVIDED CLINICAL INFORMATION: M50.322-Other cervical disc degeneration at C5-C6 level
Right C6 radiculopathy with wrist extensor and shoulder girdle weakness on exam
ADDITIONAL CLINICAL INFORMATION: None available
COMPARISON: Radiograph 6/5/2018.
INTERPRETATION:
There is mild reversal of normal lordosis, but no focal malalignment. There is no fracture or
marrow replacing process. Posterior elements are intact. The odontoid and C1-C2 relationship

C1-2: No abnormality.
C2-3: No significant central canal or foraminal stenosis.
C3-4: No significant central canal or foraminal stenosis.
C4-5: There is shallow right paramedian disc protrusion with annular fissuring effacing the right
ventral thecal sac and ventral spinal cord surface. There is mild degree of canal stenosis. The
cord is not displaced posteriorly or impinged. There is no
foraminal stenosis.
C5-6: There is moderate disc space narrowing with posterior lateral marginal osteophyte/disc
complex with right greater than left uncovertebral joint osteophyte. There is effacement of the
ventral aspect of the thecal sac. There is contacted, but no
effacement of the ventral cord surface. There is mild degree of canal stenosis. There is
moderate right, but no left foraminal stenosis.
C6-7: No significant central canal or foraminal stenosis.
C7-T1: No significant central canal or foraminal stenosis.
There is no significant stenosis at the visualized upper thoracic disc spaces.
