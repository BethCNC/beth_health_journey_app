Ms. Cartrette,
I just wanted to reach out regarding your lab testing.
Overall, I think your lab testing is quite reassuring. Cell counts,
electrolytes, kidney function, and liver function was entirely
normal.
You had a very minimal, nonspecific elevation of your
sedimentation rate (a marker of inflammation) while your C-
reactive protein (another marker of inflammation) was normal.
This is of unclear clinical significance currently.
Additional screening for underlying infections was entirely
negative.
Updated x-ray testing has been ordered of the hands/wrists in
addition to the SI joints and lumbar spine. We can complete
these at your convenience. I look forward to discussing this in
greater detail with you at our follow-up appointment
