 
Assessment:
Jennifer Beth Cartrette is a 37 y.o. Caucasian female with polyarthralgia  

1.  Polyarthralgia: With pain in the left wrist and right knee.  She finds that prednisone does not help with this pain.  Prior testing shows negative ANA, rheumatoid factor, CCP, uric acid.  She does have tenderness to palpation on exam today.  Testing that was ordered in March 2020 has yet been resulted.

2. History of bulimia: With ongoing symptoms of decreased food intake.  She does take NSAIDs daily, but also finds that she has nausea daily and requires Zofran.
 
3.  History of degenerative disc disease in the cervical spine: Status post C4-C5, C5-C6 ACDF in September 2018.  Continues to follow with orthopedics.  Daily Aleve.
 
4.  Autoimmune thyroid disease: With positive thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase antibodies noted in 2018.  Recent testing does reveal abnormal thyroid function.  She is not currently on any thyroid medications.
Plan:
 We will await her lab results, and once they are reviewed, we will consider starting Humira injections every 7 days

She will continue on steroids, will transition to Rayos 5 mg at night (samples provided today)

She will also use Vimovo, if covered by her insurance (she is aware if it is not covered, she will return to using Aleve)

She is aware that our office does not have capabilities to ultrasound with our joint aspirations, so she elects to follow with orthopedics whenever joint aspirations are required
 
She is aware that our office policy restricts my ability to prescribe nonrheumatic medications, and that I would defer management of such to her other providers
 
I encouraged her to continue to follow with her other providers as previously scheduled
 
Return to office in 3 months

To assess for drug toxicity continue monitoring blood tests once every 6  months . 

I spent 20 minutes of face-to-face time with the patient and more than half of the time was devoted to patient education discussing about the importance of increasing physical activity; medication side effects; and current management plans.
