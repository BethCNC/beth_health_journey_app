FL ARTHROGRAM SHOULDER RIGHT

2. Please see the separately dictated post arthrogram MRI for additional findings.
Narrative
HISTORY: Pain.
COMPARISONS: X-rays dated 2/14/2018.
PROCEDURE: Informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the
fluoroscopy table. The skin anterior to the right shoulder was marked and prepped and draped
in the usual sterile fashion. Following adequate local anesthesia with 1%
Xylocaine, a 22-gauge spinal needle was introduced into the glenohumeral joint. Permanent
image was obtained with the needle in the joint. Following administration of Xylocaine,
approximately 12-15 cc of dilute gadolinium (0.1 cc of gadolinium mixed with
Xylocaine and contrast) was injected during intermittent fluoroscopic observation. The needle
was removed and hemostasis was achieved. The patient tolerated the procedure well without
apparent complication.
FLUORO TIME: 18 seconds.
NUMBER OF IMAGES: 4 fluoroscopic images.
INTERPRETATION: Contrast injected into the glenohumeral joint remains within the
glenohumeral joint without evidence of extravasation to suggest full thickness rotator cuﬀ tear.10/25/24, 8:49 PM MyAtriumHealth - Test Details
