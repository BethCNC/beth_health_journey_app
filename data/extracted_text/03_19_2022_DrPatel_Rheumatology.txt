Assessment:
Jennifer
Beth
Cartrette
is
a
37
y.o.
White
or
Caucasian
female
who
presents
with
right
knee
pain
.
1.
Right
knee
pain:
With
intermittent
swelling
for
the
last
3
months.
She
has
undergone
a
number
of
aspirations
and
injections,
but
finds
that
joint
fluid
re-accumulates.
She
has
had
IV
steroids
as
well
as
oral
steroids,
but
finds
that
oral
steroids
have
been
more
beneficial.
Negative
ANA,
rheumatoid
factor,
CCP,
ESR,
CRP,
uric
acid.
She
does
follow
with
orthopedics,
who
have
recommended
right
knee
MRI,
but
this
has
not
been
completed.
2.
Left
wrist
pain:
Intermittent,
improves
with
compression.
Prior
imaging
of
the
wrist
did
not
reveal
any
acute
abnormalities.
3.
History
of
bulimia:
With
ongoing
symptoms
of
decreased
food
intake.
She
does
take
NSAIDs
daily,
but
also
finds
that
she
has
nausea
daily
and
requires
Zofran.
4.
History
of
degenerative
disc
disease
in
the
cervical
spine:
Status
post
C4-C5,
C5-C6
ACDF
in
September
2018.
Continues
to
follow
with
orthopedics.
Daily
Aleve.
5.
Autoimmune
thyroid
disease:
With
positive
thyroglobulin
and
thyroid
peroxidase
antibodies
noted
in
2018.
Recent
testing
does
reveal
abnormal
thyroid
function.
She
is
not
currently
on
any
thyroid
medications.
Plan:
I
discussed
with
her
that
at
this
time
there
is
limited
evidence
that
would
support
immediate
initiation
of
immune
suppressing
medications
We
will
check
HLA-B27,
ESR,
CRP,
CK,
ANA
comprehensive
panel,
hepatitis
panel,
QuantiFERON
gold,
CBC,
creatinine,
hepatic
function
panel
Based
upon
lab
results,
we
will
assess
if
DMARD
therapy
is
appropriate,
and
will
consider
Humira
injections
Methotrexate
is
contraindicated
as
she
is
planning
to
consider
conception
in
the
near
future
In
the
meanwhile,
she
will
start
prednisone
10
mg
daily
for
2
weeks,
then
5
mg
daily
for
2
weeks,
then
stop
I
would
recommend
consideration
for
MRI
of
the
right
knee
if
pain
does
not
respond
to
prednisone
She
is
aware
that
our
office
does
not
have
capabilities
to
ultrasound
with
our
joint
aspirations,
so
she
elects
to
follow
with
orthopedics
whenever
joint
aspirations
are
required
She
is
aware
that
our
office
policy
restricts
my
ability
to
prescribe
nonrheumatic
medications,
and
that
I
would
defer
management
of
such
to
her
other
providers
I
encouraged
her
to
continue
to
follow
with
her
other
providers
as
previously
scheduled
Return
to
office
in
3
to
4
months

--- Page 4 ---
I
spent
40
minutes
of
face-to-face
time
with
the
patient
and
more
than
half
of
the
time
was
devoted
to
patient
education
discussing
about
differential
diagnoses;
current
management
plans,
and
future
treatment
options.
Subjective:
Jennifer
Beth
Cartrette
is
a
37
y.o.
female
who
is
being
evaluated
in
consultation
at
the
request
of
her
Orthopedic
provider,
Eric
Chandley,
PA,
for
right
knee
effusion.
She
was
normal
state
of
health,
but
recalls
upper
and
lower
back
pain
since
high
school.
She
attributed
this
to
gymnastics
and
having
large
breasts.
She
had
considered
breast
reduction,
but
did
not
do
this.
As
she
became
older,
she
continued
to
have
back
pain.
She
did
notice
stiffness
in
her
hands,
worse
after
overuse
as
a
massage
therapist.
She
was
working
with
a
physiatrist,
who
did
do
injections
into
the
soft
tissue.
She
did
not
find
benefit
from
these.
She
did
blood
work
and
was
found
to
have
a
positive
RF.
She
was
planning
to
see
a
rheumatologist,
but
due
to
her
boyfriend
being
diagnosed
with
brain
cancer,
she
did
not
follow
with
one.
She
has
had
repeat
testing,
which
was
negative.
In
November
2019,
she
began
having
left
wrist
pain.
She
noted
swelling
on
the
palmar
aspect
of
the
left
forearm.
This
led
to
numbness
in
her
hand
and
palm.
She
wore
a
carpal
tunnel
brace,
which
helped.
But
her
symptoms
continued
and
began
to
happen
during
the
day.
She
finds
that
wrapping
her
wrist
controls
the
swelling
and
numbness.
In
December
2019,
she
had
acute
onset
of
pain
in
the
right
knee.
She
noted
swelling
at
that
time.
She
began
wearing
knee
brace
at
that
time.
She
had
continued
swelling
and
pain
and
went
to
the
ED.
In
the
ED,
they
did
a
knee
aspiration
and
injection
and
was
provided
with
steroid
taper.
This
helped
with
both
knee
and
wrist
pain/swelling.
Within
a
few
hours
of
stopping
prednisone,
her
symptoms
returned.
She
was
referred
to
Orthopedics.
MRI,
ultrasound,
aspiration,
etc
was
normal.
She
was
told
for
possible
autoimmune
cause
of
her
symptoms.
After
joint
injection,
she
had
recurrent
swelling
5
days
after.
She
had
to
go
back
to
the
ED,
and
was
again
given
IV
steroids.
This
helped,
but
again,
was
only
temporary
in
providing
relief.
She
started
oral
prednisone
the
following
day.
She
finds
that
oral
steroids
are
helpful,
but
other
forms
of
steroids
are
not
efficacious.
Throughout
this
time,
she
has
been
diagnosed
for
erysipelas
of
the
face.
She
has
been
prescribed
Bactrim
and
bactroban.
She
has
discussed
MRI
of
the
right
knee,
but
this
has
not
been
ordered.
She
endorses
dry
eyes
(worse
with
contact
lens
use)
and
dry
mouth.
No
inflammatory
eye
diagnoses.
No
IBD-like
symptoms.
No
history
of
Achilles
tendinitis.
She
does
notice
swelling
in
her
entire
finger/toes.
She
endorses
AM
stiffness
lasting
for
about
30
minutes.
Alternating
cold
and
heat
application
helps.
No
personal
history
of
psoriasis.
