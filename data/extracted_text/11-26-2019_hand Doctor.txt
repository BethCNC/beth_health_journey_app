Attestation signed by Brandon Valentine at 11/26/19 1035
Patient seen in the office today, history reviewed, and examined.
Agree with physician assistant recorded history and exam.
The presenting history and exam are most consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome. This
condition is reviewed at length in the office today.
We have discussed the etiology, pathophysiology, natural history, and treatment options
for this condition. I have explained that with progressive symptoms I recommend
electrodiagnostic testing to confirm the location and define the severity of any focal
compressive neuropathy.
She may be a candidate for carpal tunnel release to prevent any permanent or further
loss of feeling and strength in the hand. We have discussed the surgical procedure for
carpal tunnel release in the office today as well, along with the risks and benefits.
She agrees to proceed with nerve study, and this is ordered today.
Follow-up after nerve study.
