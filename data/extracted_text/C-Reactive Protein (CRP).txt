Ms. Cartrette,
I just wanted to reach out regarding your lab testing.
Overall, I think your lab testing is quite reassuring. Cell counts,
electrolytes, kidney function, and liver function was entirely
normal.
You had a very minimal, nonspecific elevation of your
sedimentation rate (a marker of inflammation) while your Creactive protein (another marker of inflammation) was normal.
This is of unclear clinical significance currently.
Additional screening for underlying infections was entirely
negative.
Updated x-ray testing has been ordered of the hands/wrists in
addition to the SI joints and lumbar spine. We can complete
these at your convenience. I look forward to discussing this in
greater detail with you at our follow-up appointment
