Access
to
your
records
is
your
right
as
a
patient.
However,
they
are
formal
medical
documents
that
are
intended
for
medical
use
by
clinicians
and
therefore
contain
clinical
meanings,
abbreviations,
and
medical
language
with
which
you
may
be
unfamiliar.
If
you
have
questions
about
anything
on
your
record,
please
discuss
it
with
your
provider
at
your
next
visit.
