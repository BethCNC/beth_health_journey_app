Subjective
Patient
ID:
Jennifer
Beth
Cartrette
is
a
40
y.o.
female.
Chief
Complaint
Patient
presents
with
•
Consult
HPI
Ms.
Cartrette
is
a
pleasant
40
y.o.
F
with
a
PMH
of
bipolar
d/o,
ADHD,
PTSD,
anorexia,
and
presumptive
PsA
here
for
continued
evaluation
and
management
of
joint
pain
Notably,
she
has
previously
followed
with
rheumatology
evaluation,
last
following
with
Dr.
Patel
(Novant
-
LOV
9/2022).
She
mentioned
following
since
2019
for
ongoing
widespread
pain
with
emphasis
at
the
level
of
the
hands/wrists,
upper
neck,
lower
back,
hips,
knees,
ankles,
and
feet.
Pain
can
really
be
at
anytime
of
day,
but
she
does
wonder
about
worsening
symptoms
early
in
the
morning
with
associated
morning
stiffness
being
upwards
of
multiple
hours.
Upon
establishing
at
Novant
initially,
notable
work-up
included
negative
ANA,
RF/CCP,
HLA-B27,
uric
acid,
CRP/ESR.
She
was
started
on
Humira
(7/2020),
which
was
discontinued
shortly
thereafter
(10/2020)
due
to
ongoing
skin
infections
of
the
face.
She
was
started
on
hydroxychloroquine
(3/2022)
which
was
shortly
thereafter
discontinued
(5/2022)
due
to
tinnitus.
Methotrexate
was
initiated
(5/2022),
and
intermittent
steroids
have
been
utilized
with
partial
benefit.
She
notably
has
a
prior
diagnosis
of
psoriatic
arthritis
based
off
of
the
work-up
and
evaluation
above
with
a
concern
about
an
underlying
inflammatory
arthritis
in
a
pattern
consistent
with
peripheral
and
axial
symptoms.
She
has
never
exhibited
symptoms
of
skin
psoriasis.
More
recently,
she
does
present
with
a
multitude
of
symptoms.
She
includes
GI
distress
including
ongoing
abdominal
pain,
bloating,
and
constipation
with
chronic
nausea.
She
also
has
a
chronic
brain
fog
and
inability
to
focus.
She
does
have
a
known
diagnosis
of
ADHD,
bipolar
disorder,
anorexia,
and
PTSD.
She
is
maintained
on
Adderall
right
now
and
is
trying
to
establish
with
behavioral
health.
She
also
has
neuropathic
symptoms
chronically
across
the
body
including
nonspecific
cramping
pain
showing
up
at
the
level
of
the
calves
in
addition
to
an
intermittent
numbness
and
tingling
showing
up
in
the
lower
extremities
in
general.
Additionally
has
"body
temperature"
changes.
Has
followed
with
ophthalmology
more
recently
and
had
an
evaluation
highly
suggestive
of
thyroid
eye
disease.
Does
have
upcoming
follow-up
with
endocrinology.
Last
TSH
was
actually
normal,
although
there
was
slightly
elevated
TPO
antibodies.
At
one
point
did
have
TSH
around
7.

Assessment/Plan
1.
Inflammatory
polyarthritis
-Widespread
peripheral
and
axial
manifestations;
suspect
some
component
of
inflammatory
descriptors
(worse
at
night,
stiffness,
swelling);
exam
with
minimal
areas
of
joint
fullness
across
the
hands
-
I
suspect
that
there
is
some
component
of
an
inflammatory
arthritis;
however,
I
am
not
sure
all
pain
stems
from
inflammation.
Patient
does
have
a
known
history
of
PTSD
and
anorexia
related
to
childhood
trauma,
and
this
could
have
a
psychosomatic
manifestation
-Update
inflammatory
markers
and
monitoring
lab
work
today
-Structural
imaging
of
the
hand/wrist,
SI
joints,
and
spine
today
**Consideration
of
bilateral
hand/wrist
ultrasound
if
no
evidence
of
active
inflammation
by
work-up
noted
above;
this
would
be
to
help
a
catalog
residual
inflammation
**Would
continue
with
methotrexate
4
tabs
weekly
with
daily
folic
acid
for
now
**Additional
treatment
recommendations
after
work-up
above
2.
Chronic
Lower
Back
Pain
-Notably
with
a
history
of
axial
disease
as
well;
does
have
a
history
of
cervical
fusion
already,
and
now
more
recently
with
lower
back
and
buttock
space
pain/discomfort
-With
concerning
features
of
axial
spondyloarthritis
or
PsA,
have
to
be
concerned
about
an
axial
component
to
seronegative
spondylarthritis,
and
I
will
add
SI
and
lumbar
films
today
**May
need
considerations
of
MRI
of
the
pelvis
to
look
for
active
sacroiliitis
