HI Jennifer, thyroid antibody levels are high. These results are
consistent with Graves disease. However, your thyroid hormone
levels have returned to the normal range. This suggest, your
Graves disease is undergoing remission. This is a good news. No
thyroid medication is indicated at this point. Repeat thyroid labs
in 2 months. Contact us for any questions. Thanks.
