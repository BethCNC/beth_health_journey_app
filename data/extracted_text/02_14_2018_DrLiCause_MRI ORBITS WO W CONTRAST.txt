       The MRI does show slight prominence of the right more than left
       eye (but not clearly Graves) and with the abnormalities of the
       thyroid labs, I would like her to see Dr Talip for her
       recommendations. Once she is aware, please make this referral.
       We may also try to call you regarding this. We will need
       documentation that you have received these instructions. Take
       care, Dr. LiCause

       I am afraid I don't know the answer, but if Dr Talip does not feel
       this is related to Graves, we will have her see an ENT. Thank you.




     Results
       Impression
       IMPRESSION: Orbital asymmetry as described. No definite orbital mass lesion on the right.
       Question mild old medial orbital wall injury on the left. Left sphenoethmoidal opacification
       also noted.

       Narrative
       HISTORY: Proptosis.

       COMPARISON: None.

       Multisequence, multiplanar images were performed on a high field MRI through the orbits
       before and after the uneventful ministration of 6 cc Gadavist IV.

       There is slight orbital asymmetry with the right globe protruding further than the left. I see no
       intra or extraconal mass lesion to account for this, and the orbital fat is preserved. The
       extraocular muscles are unremarkable. Slight asymmetric inward
       bowing of the left medial orbital wall suggests a possible remote left orbital injury. There is also
       opacification of a left posterior ethmoid cell with opacification of adjacent portions of a

       elsewhere within the ethmoids. No fluid level.

       The visualized intracranial structures are unremarkable.
