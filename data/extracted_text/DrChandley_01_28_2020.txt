maximum
discomfort
the

placed
their
fingers
over
the
anterior

She
has
not

the

quickly
returned.

includes
Hashimoto's
thyroiditis.
The
patient
reports
years
ago
she
saw
a
rheumatologist
and
had

Plan:
I
believe
the
patient
would
benefit
from
rheumatology
consultation.
Most
of
her
local
rheumatologist
will
not
see
the
patient
unless
they
have
a
positive
lab
study.
We
will
order
the
typical
rheumatological
panel
for
her
condition.
The
patient
keeps
suffering
from
recurrent
knee
effusions
after
she
tapers
off
of
steroids.
If
she
is
having
from
an
untreated
autoimmune
disease
this
makes
sense.
Gout
and
pseudogout
can
create
erythema
and
severe
swelling
of
the
knee.
I
did
consider
mechanical
causes
of
her
symptoms
such
as
a
torn
meniscus
or
cartilage
injury.
The
patient
reports
a
history
of
carpal
tunnel
like
symptoms
that
completely
resolved
with
steroidal
medication.
I
told
her
I
have
seen
myxedema
the
risk
rate
carpal
tunnel
symptoms
in
the
past.
She
may
benefit
from
a
steroid
injection
to
the
carpal
tunnel.
She
reports
that
taking
steroids
for
the
past
5
days
and
has
absolutely
no
numbness
or
tingling
in
her
hand.
She
reports
dramatic
improvement
in
the
swelling
in
her
knee
since
taking
the
steroids.
She
is
very
concerned
that
when
she
stopped
taking
the
steroids
the
knee
will
quickly
swell
and
become
very
painful.
I
told
her
the
steroid
injection
delivered
into
the
joint
should
last
for
4
weeks.
She
would
like
to
proceed
with
aspiration
injection
of
the
knee.
We
will
send
aspirate
to
the
lab
for
analysis
for
crystal-based
diseases,
cell
count,
Gram
stain,
and
culture.
I
discussed
the
risks
and
benefits
of
aspiration
and
injection
of
the
right
knee.
After
this
discussion
the
patient
would
like
to
proceed
with
the
procedure.
I
prepped
the
anterior
and
lateral
aspects
of
the
knee
with
rubbing
alcohol.
Using
ultrasound
guidance
and
sterile
technique
I
injected
3
mL
of
one
percent
lidocaine
to
provide
local
anesthesia.
After
local
anesthesia
was
achieved
I
inserted
an
18
gauge
needle
into
the
effusion
without
difficulty.
I
then
aspirated
12
cc
of
cloudy
yellow
straw
colored
fluid
was
removed
from
the
knee
without
difficulty.
I
then
injected
18
mg
of
Celestone
and
1
mL
of
0.25%
of
Marcaine.The
patient
tolerated
the
procedure
very
well.
Images
were
captured
for
the
medical
record.
The
patient
will
follow
up
with
on
a
PRN
basis.
If
we
do
not
find
anything
on
a
rheumatological
work-up
and
she
does
not
respond
to
steroid
injection
I
would
recommend
MRI
right
knee.
The
patient
was
mildly
tachycardic
on
today's
visit.
This
may
be
an
adverse
side
effect
of
her
ADHD
medication,
recurrence
of
her
Graves'
disease,
or
simply
being
nervous
that
she
is
in
a
doctor's
office.
Her
primary
care
physician
will
monitor
her
heart
rate.
I
did
not
reorder
the
TSI
level
or
the
antibody
level
because
it
is
irrelevant
at
this
time.
The
patient
has
autoimmune
disease
and
reordering
these
tests
would
not
affect
management.
