HISTORY
OF
PRESENT
ILLNESS
The
patient
presents
for
evaluation
of
Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome.
The
patient,
98
percent
certain
that
she
is
autistic,
suspects
that
her
joint
and
health
issues
may
be
related
to
hypermobility
syndrome
and
Ehlers-Dlos
syndrome.
Her
rheumatologist,
Dr.
Banker,
concurred
with
her
and
recommended
a
specialist
for
these
conditions.
Despite
being
generally
smart,
she
struggles
with
social
and
communication
skills.
On
04/27/2023,
she
scored
a
99
percent
of
autism
assessment.
Her
goal
is
to
seek
alternate
assessments
for
adults
and
the
Teach
Institute
in
Charlotte,
where
free
assessments
and
research
centers
are
available.
Her
condition
has
escalated
to
the
point
where
she
has
not
left
her
house
in
4
years
due
to
illness
and
pain.
She
is
unable
to
communicate
her
pain
and
requires
assistance
with
food
and
sleep.
Despite
being
unable
to
perform
routine
tasks,
she
manages
to
engage
in
advanced
tasks.
She
underwent
an
ADHD
assessment
in
her
20s,
which
revealed
a
high
Q
and
subsequent
follow-up
testing
for
a
learning
disability,
which
revealed
a
severe
reading
comprehensive
learning
disability.
Her
rheumatologist
diagnosed
her
with
hypermobility
syndrome
and
Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome.
She
has
a
history
of
fainting
episodes
and
has
been
taking
Zofran
daily
for
the
past
4
years
for
persistent
nausea.
Currently,
she
does
not
faint,
but
experiences
constant
lightheadedness.
She
recognizes
when
to
sit
down
and
when
she
needs
to
eat.
In
her
20s,
she
was
hospitalized
for
starvation
and
required
a
feeding
tube.
She
lives
on
milk
and
protein
powder
and
has
difficulty
remembering
to
shower
and
eat.
She
believes
her
grandmother
and
aunt
had
Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome.
Her
grandmother
was
unable
to
lift
her
right
arm
and
died
of
a
stomach
aneurysm.
She
has
temperature
sensitivity
and
dental
crowding
due
to
Ehlers-
Danlos
syndrome.
Her

--- Page 4 ---
psychiatrist
prescribed
Zoloft
and
propranolol,
but
she
has
not
taken
them
due
to
fear.
She
is
due
for
a
follow-up
with
her
psychiatrist
at
the
Center
for
Emotional
Health.
She
is
considering
reaching
out
to
Monroe
who
is
a
patient
advocate
for
Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome.
She
has
not
worked
in
4
years
and
does
not
wish
to
go
on
disability.
She
has
dentures,
but
she
has
not
been
able
to
wear
them
due
to
sensory
issues.
She
had
a
protrusion
in
her
chest
in
2018
and
has
been
diagnosed
with
costochondritis.
