       Labs suggest mild Hashimoto's but no treatment or intervention
       needed. Repeat TSH and free T4 every 6 months. Hope you are
       doing well and please let us know if you have any questions.
       Take care, Dr. LiCause

       Hello! Please forgive me, I did not give you as much information
       in my note to you as I should have. I should have said that I
       suspect you have subclinical hyperthyroidism (early Hashimoto's
       is only 1 way this can happen). Subclinical hyperthyroidism can
       sometimes lead to Graves disease (a cause for the eyes to
       sometimes become more prominent). I do want you to proceed
       with the MRI ordered of the orbits and would like you to come in
       for one other thyroid blood test. If the MRI confirms Graves, then
       I would want you to see an endocrinologist (Dr Talip) to review
       how to proceed from there. If the MRI does not confirm Grave's
       disease, then you should get TSH and free T4 every 3 months for
       the next year.
