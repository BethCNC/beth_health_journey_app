The results of your recent blood work are included below. Most
of your lab results look excellent and are normal at this time.
1. Thyroid antibody slightly elevated consistent with likely
Hashimoto's. TSH and free T4 were normal.
2. Labs overall unremarkable
Please follow-up in clinic as we discussed at the time of your
appointment.
Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your
health. If you have any questions or concerns, please give us a
call at the clinic so we can ensure that we are meeting all of your
health care needs.

Warmest Regards,
Tim Kennard, MD

Thyroglobulin Antibody measured by Beckman Coulter Methodology
It should be noted that the presence of thyroglobulin antibodies
may not be pathogenic nor diagnostic, especially at very low

individuals without evidence of thyroid disease or autoimmunity
