I have reviewed your recent lab results.
Your blood counts, kidney function and liver function are all
within normal ranges.
The testing we did looking for antibodies and markers assessed
with conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid
arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, scleroderma, inflammatory
muscle diseases, psoriatic arthritis all came back normal. Both
markers of inflammation were within normal ranges.
Because of these normal lab results, starting a stronger immune
suppressing medication would not be recommended. We could
consider starting a medication such as hydroxychloroquine to
monitor your response. This is a medication that is not an
immune suppressing medication, but is a medication that can
take a number of months to build up in your system and take
effect. You can read more about medications website below.

Please let me know if you have any questions about this
medication, or if you feel comfortable with me sending a
prescription to your local pharmacy.
