Hello Jennifer Beth Cartrette
Your pap smear results have returned.  There were some questionable cells (termed "abnormal
cells of undetermined signiﬁcance").  When we get this result, we have the lab test for the HPV
virus, which causes almost all precancerous cellular abnormalities.  This result was negative.  That
combination of results is very reassuring and based on current national guidelines, I recommend
repeating the pap smear in three years BUT still have once yearly GYN visit and exam.  Please let
us know if you have any questions.

Gyn Interpretation: Comment 
EPITHELIAL CELL ABNORMALITY.
ATYPICAL SQUAMOUS CELLS OF UNDETERMINED
SIGNIFICANCE.
Gyn Note: Comment
The Pap smear is a screening test designed to aid in the
detection of
premalignant and malignant conditions of the uterine cervix.  It is
not a
diagnostic procedure and should not be used as the sole means
of detecting
cervical cancer.  Both false-positive and false-negative reports do
occur.
HPV Aptima: Negative  (Range: Negative)
This test detects fourteen high-risk HPV types
(16/18/31/33/35/39/45/
51/52/56/58/59/66/68) without differentiation.
Microscopic Observation: .
