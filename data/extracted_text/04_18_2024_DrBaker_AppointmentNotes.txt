Subjective
Patient
ID:
Jennifer
Beth
Cartrette
is
a
41
y.o.
female.
Chief
Complaint
Patient
presents
with
•
Follow-up
HPI
Rheumatology
History:
Ms.
Cartrette
is
a
pleasant
F
with
a
PMH
of
bipolar
d/o,
ADHD,
PTSD,
anorexia,
and
presumptive
PsA
here
for
continued
evaluation
and
management
of
joint
pain.
Initial
consultation
with
myself
was
pursued
on
6/6/2023
Notably,
she
has
previously
followed
with
rheumatology
evaluation,
last
following
with
Dr.
Patel
(Novant
-
LOV
9/2022).
She
mentioned
following
since
2019
for
ongoing
widespread
pain
with
emphasis
at
the
level
of
the
hands/wrists,
upper
neck,
lower
back,
hips,
knees,
ankles,
and
feet.
Pain
can
really
be
at
anytime
of
day,
but
she
does
wonder
about
worsening
symptoms
early
in
the
morning
with
associated
morning
stiffness
being
upwards
of
multiple
hours.
Upon
establishing
at
Novant
initially,
notable
work-up
included
negative
ANA,
RF/CCP,
HLA-B27,
uric
acid,
CRP/ESR.
She
notably
has
a
prior
diagnosis
of
psoriatic
arthritis
based
off
of
the
work-up
and
evaluation
above
with
a
concern
about
an
underlying
inflammatory
arthritis
in
a
pattern
consistent
with
peripheral
and
axial
symptoms.
She
has
never
exhibited
symptoms
of
skin
psoriasis.
More
recently,
she
does
present
with
a
multitude
of
symptoms.
She
includes
GI
distress
including
ongoing
abdominal
pain,
bloating,
and
constipation
with
chronic
nausea.
She
also
has
a
chronic
brain
fog
and
inability
to
focus.
She
does
have
a
known
diagnosis
of
ADHD,
bipolar
disorder,
anorexia,
and
PTSD.
She
is
maintained
on
Adderall
right
now
and
is
trying
to
establish
with
behavioral
health.
She
also
has
neuropathic
symptoms
chronically
across
the
body
including
nonspecific
cramping
pain
showing
up
at
the
level
of
the
calves
in
addition
to
an
intermittent
numbness
and
tingling
showing
up
in
the
lower
extremities
in
general.
Additionally
has
"body
temperature"
changes.
Has
followed
with
ophthalmology
more
recently
and
had
an
evaluation
highly
suggestive
of
thyroid
eye
disease.
Does
have
upcoming
follow-up
with
endocrinology.
Last
TSH
was
actually
normal,
although
there
was
slightly
elevated
TPO
antibodies.
At
one
point
did
have
TSH
around
7.

Rx
History:
She
was
started
on
Humira
(7/2020),
which
was
discontinued
shortly
thereafter
(10/2020)
due
to
ongoing
skin
infections
of
the
face.
She
was
started
on
hydroxychloroquine
(3/2022)
which
was
shortly
thereafter
discontinued
(5/2022)
due
to
tinnitus.
Methotrexate
was
initiated
(5/2022),
and
intermittent
steroids
have
been
utilized
with
partial
benefit.
Interval
History:
LOV
8/2023
In
the
interim,
Ms.
Cartrette
admits
that
after
our
last
office
visit
there
was
increasing
anxiety
and
PTSD
leading
to
a
period
of
time
where
she
did
not
follow
with
doctors
routinely.
She
states
that
she
has
actually
been
stretching
her
methotrexate
out
to
taking
every
10
days
or
even
every
2
weeks.
She
has
been
out
of
methotrexate
entirely
for
the
better
part
of
1
to
2
weeks.
Symptoms
persist.
She
continues
to
have
widespread
pain
both
peripherally
and
axially.
Pain
is
typically
worse
at
the
hands,
elbows,
shoulders,
lower
back,
lateral
hips,
knees,
ankles,
and
feet.
Pain
can
be
at
anytime
of
day,
perhaps
worse
overnight
and
first
thing
in
the
morning
but
noted
throughout
the
entirety
of
the
day.
She
does
wonder
about
a
fullness
nonspecifically
across
the
fingers.
Associated
symptoms
including
a
burning
sensation
across
the
skin
intermittently
in
addition
to
some
erythema
generally
showing
up
across
the
digits.
She
continues
to
have
some
"infection"
type
rashes
showing
up
and
around
the
lips
and
face.
She
continues
to
use
topical
treatments
to
try
and
benefit
this.
No
new
pattern
to
her
chest
pain;
still
gets
some
palpitations.
No
new
cough
or
shortness
of
breath.
Has
a
chronic
fatigue
and
brain
fog.
No
new
definitive
eye
inflammation.
No
fevers.

Assessment/Plan
1.
Inflammatory
polyarthritis
-Widespread
peripheral
and
axial
manifestations;
suspect
some
component
of
inflammatory
descriptors
(worse
at
night,
stiffness,
swelling);
exam
with
minimal
areas
of
joint
fullness
across
the
hands
-
I
suspect
that
there
is
some
component
of
an
inflammatory
arthritis;
however,
I
am
not
sure
all
pain
stems
from
inflammation.
Patient
does
have
a
known
history
of
PTSD
and
anorexia
related
to
childhood
trauma,
and
this
could
have
a
psychosomatic
manifestation
-At
this
point,
I
think
it
is
reasonable
to
reassess
the
degree
of
inflammatory
arthritis.
**We
will
pursue
bilateral
hand/wrist
ultrasound
if
no
evidence
of
active
inflammation
by
work-up
noted
above;
this
would
be
to
help
a
catalog
residual
inflammation
**I
am
recommending
holding
disease
modifying
therapy
including
methotrexate
and
folic
acid
for
now
**Additional
treatment
recommendations
after
work-up
above

--- Page 10 ---
2.
Chronic
Lower
Back
Pain,
Bilateral
Hip
Bursitis
-Notably
with
a
history
of
axial
disease
as
well;
does
have
a
history
of
cervical
fusion
already,
and
now
more
recently
with
lower
back
and
buttock
space
pain/discomfort
-With
regards
to
inflammatory
arthritis,
need
to
be
cognizant
of
possible
seronegative
spondylarthritis;
workup
has
included
negative
HLA-B27
with
SI
films
being
normal
-
Lumbar
films
did
show
some
straightening
of
normal
lordosis
in
addition
to
some
facet
arthritis
**I
am
recommending
conservative
physical
therapy
at
this
time.
If
failure
of
conservative
therapy,
likely
to
pursue
MRI
of
the
pelvis
to
look
for
nonradiographic
sacroiliitis
