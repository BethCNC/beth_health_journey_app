 
Assessment:
Jennifer Beth Cartrette is a 39 y.o. Caucasian female with presumed psoriatic arthritis
 
1.  Presumed psoriatic arthritis: Ongoing symptoms. With prior pain in the left wrist and right knee.  She finds that prednisone does not help with this pain.  Prior testing shows negative ANA, rheumatoid factor, CCP, HLA-B27, uric acid, ESR, CRP.  HCQ started 3/2022, discontinued in 5/2022 due to ringing in the ears. She does have diffuse tenderness to palpation on exam today.  She has found benefit from prednisone in the past
 
2.  Use of high-risk medications: Hydroxychloroquine, no vision deficits.  Baseline eye exam not yet completed.

3. History of bulimia: With ongoing symptoms of decreased food intake.  She does take NSAIDs daily, but also finds that she has nausea daily and requires Zofran.
 
4. History of degenerative disc disease in the cervical spine: With ongoing pain. Status post C4-C5, C5-C6 ACDF in September 2018. Daily Ibuprofen.
 
5. Autoimmune thyroid disease: With positive thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase antibodies noted in 2018.  Recent testing does reveal abnormal thyroid function.  She is not currently on any thyroid medications.
Plan:
 Remain off of HCQ given tinnitus

Start MTX 10mg PO weekly with daily folic acid

Check CBC, Cr, HFP in 4 weeks

She is aware that our office policy restricts my ability to prescribe nonrheumatic medications, and that I would defer management of such to her other providers
 
Food insecurity screening, depression screening, tobacco status updated in patient's chart
 
I encouraged her to continue to follow with her other providers as previously scheduled
 
Return to office in 4 months

To assess for drug toxicity continue monitoring blood tests once every 6 months . 

I spent 25 minutes of face-to-face time with the patient and more than half of the time was devoted to patient education discussing about the importance of increasing physical activity; DMARD side effects; and current management plans.
