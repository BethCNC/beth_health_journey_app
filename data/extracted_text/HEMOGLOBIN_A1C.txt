Labs suggest mild Hashimoto's but no treatment or intervention
needed. Repeat TSH and free T4 every 6 months. Hope you are
doing well and please let us know if you have any questions.
Take care, Dr. LiCause

Hello! Please forgive me, I did not give you as much information
in my note to you as I should have. I should have said that I
suspect you have subclinical hyperthyroidism (early Hashimoto's
is only 1 way this can happen). Subclinical hyperthyroidism can
sometimes lead to Graves disease (a cause for the eyes to
sometimes become more prominent). I do want you to proceed
with the MRI ordered of the orbits and would like you to come in
for one other thyroid blood test. If the MRI confirms Graves, then
I would want you to see an endocrinologist (Dr Talip) to review
how to proceed from there. If the MRI does not confirm Grave's
disease, then you should get TSH and free T4 every 3 months for
the next year.
