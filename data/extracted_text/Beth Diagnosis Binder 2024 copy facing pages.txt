Introduction
Purpose of This Binder
This binder has been meticulously compiled in a desperate attempt to secure an official Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis at the University of North Carolina TEACCH® Autism Program in Charlotte. My ultimate goal is to obtain the crucial support services necessary to manage my basic human needs effectively, freeing up my mental and emotional resources to focus on my career and achieve financial stability.
Personal Background and Motivation
For the past four years, my life has been a relentless battle with severe illness. Diagnosed with multiple autoimmune diseases, I have become virtually housebound. I have lost almost everything—my teeth, my eyesight, my job, my financial independence, and even my family. I have consulted over 160 doctors, only to find myself caught in a vicious cycle of ever-increasing diagnoses and no real answers.
Throughout my life, I have felt different, misunderstood, and isolated. These feelings have been accompanied by chronic illness and excruciating pain. It wasn’t until April 20, 2024, when an online autism test revealed a high score, that I began to understand the root cause of my struggles. This discovery has led me to immerse myself in the study of autism, and I am astounded by how deeply it resonates with every aspect of my life from childhood to now.
Goals of Diagnosis
Nutrition and Eating:
I urgently need professional assistance from a nutritionist or dietitian to manage my Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID).
Sleep Management:
I require guidance to develop healthy sleep patterns. Currently, I only feel comfortable and safe at night when I can unmask, leading to severe and debilitating sleep deprivation.
Mental Health:
It is crucial for me to learn strategies to manage obsessive thoughts and understand my autistic brain to alleviate some of the overwhelming mental strain.
Validation and Understanding:
An official ASD diagnosis will provide much-needed clarity and validation for my lifelong struggles. It will also help others, especially my family, to better understand my challenges and needs. My inability to communicate effectively has led to severe misunderstandings and accusations of selfishness and being horrible from my own mother.
Professional and Personal Growth:
With appropriate support, I aspire to harness my strengths and focus on my career. This diagnosis is essential for me to become the best version of myself, something I so desperately desire and deserve.
The Urgent Need for Change
My mental health is deteriorating, exacerbated by constantly masking and the unending effort to scan and meet others’ needs, while my own go unmet. The intense social anxiety and inability to communicate have isolated me further. I often spend at least two hours a day crying in pain, overwhelmed by my circumstances.
Despite this, when I am in a doctor’s office, I mask my pain, nod politely, and pretend to be fine, leading to misunderstandings and inadequate care. I also struggle with alexithymia, making it difficult to verbalize my feelings, and delayed processing, causing me to think of what to say long after the appointment is over.
This binder is my plea for someone to truly listen. It contains my complete medical history, assessments, and personal annotations on how the DSM-5 criteria apply to me. I hope this will help bridge the gap between my lived experiences and the medical understanding of my condition, paving the way for the support I so desperately need.

Background Story
Background And Medical History
Part 1:
My Background Story
My Granny and I
This is a photograph of my Granny and me circa 1990. I believe my Granny had the same condition I have, and I feel her voice needs to be heard for the first time. She couldn’t lift her right arm for the last 15 years of her life. She always said she was super flexible like me when she was younger, had loose skin that I loved to rub, lost her teeth, had a hunchback, and died suddenly from a stomach aneurysm. She suffered from severe social anxiety and never put her needs first.
My Realization
Recently, after three years of disengaging from life and obsessively learning design or researching my symptoms, I realized that I might be autistic and have gone my entire life without a diagnosis. I am also diagnosed with ADHD, and I think my psychiatrists and I were very close to identifying my autism when I was in my early twenties. During that time, I underwent an assessment that clearly indicated attention deficits and was advised to follow up with further testing for learning disabilities. It was discovered that I have a reading comprehension learning disability, despite having a very high IQ. This, combined with my social inadequacies, obsessive and repetitive behaviors, and overall life experiences, all started to make sense once I understood what autism actually was and how much it correlates with my life.
Childhood Experiences
As a child, I always felt different, insecure, scared, and worried. I never understood why, but at the age of ten, I lost most of my hair, developed bulimia and anorexia, and started a lifelong, extremely toxic relationship with food. The doctors suggested stress and anxiety were the causes of my hair loss. My parents were getting separated, and I never felt like I could stop doing my job, which was to make sure everyone was happy all the time. I struggled to make friends and was always in the shadows of my older sister or older best friend. In hindsight, I realize that I had stimming behaviors that were quickly shamed and shut down.
The Impact on My Life
I quickly learned it was my job to keep the peace and be seen and not heard. I was taught that the only issue with me being in pain was that I needed to learn not to complain about it—not to deal with it, address it, or even acknowledge it. I vividly remember being forced to quit travel soccer because I frequently got hurt and always complained about the pain. It turned out I had Sever’s Disease (Calcaneal Apophysitis) and eventually got a special shoe insert from the doctor to help with the pain. This key life lesson has plagued me and is one of the main reasons I suffer so much
physically now. I have never known how to communicate my level of pain to medical professionals, adults, or anyone who can actually help me. After so many years of my shoulder hurting at an intolerable level and no one believing me, I began to even question if my pain was real. At the same time, I was researching people who could mentally convince themselves to endure and even enjoy pain so that I could learn to breathe through my pain and convince my brain it wasn’t real, which I actually got pretty good at.
Once I had spinal fusion surgery to “fix” my shoulder pain that had been controlling my life for almost ten years, I started experiencing other health problems that were too significant to be ignored. I have always struggled with nausea and vomiting, which I have attributed to my many years of bulimia. I started throwing up almost every single day, every time I tried to do anything that required energy. I would carry grocery bags as vomit bags in my car for the ride to and from work as I always got sick then. I even started getting in trouble at work for going to the bathroom too much because I was always sick and didn’t tell anyone the reasons I needed to be in the bathroom so often.
Then came my swollen knee and a staph infection on my face, both appearing simultaneously in December of 2019 (four months post-spinal fusion). Both of these issues were so unexpected and severe, and also untreatable. From this point on, my health and body have continued to deteriorate, leading me to endless doctor’s appointments, diagnoses, misdiagnoses, medical gaslighting, and most importantly, chronic pain and joint damage.
Discovering My Autism
On April 27, 2024, after another typical day of obsessively trying to figure out what was wrong with me—why I felt so physically terrible and struggled with communication skills—I stumbled upon an online assessment for autism in adults. I was completely shocked when I scored a 99%, indicating there was a 99% chance I
had
autism spectrum disorder. I proceeded to take several other online assessments and aced every single one, scoring in the highest category on every test.
Before this time, I did not have a clear understanding of what autism even was. It had never crossed my mind to include that word in my life or vocabulary, but after each test, I found myself relating to everything I read or saw about living life as an undiagnosed autistic female. I even tried to find things to convince myself I was wrong, but I couldn’t. I had never heard the term “masking” until then, and once I understood what masking was, everything started falling into place.
Masking My True Self
Masking is all I know. I quickly learned I have no idea how to exist in a world that requires me to make my own decisions based on what I need and want. Not only do I have no idea how to do this, but transitioning into adulthood and independence has been literally impossible for me, as I only know how to function if I am doing something someone wants or needs from me. I truly have no idea how to think for myself and make decisions based on what I want. I don’t even know what I want, actually. All I have ever known is to copy and paste other people’s behaviors and to follow the “rules” or standards that society deems necessary for certain situations.
I always excelled in school or work settings. I was in college for almost ten years and I loved it. I now realize it was because, in these situations, there are standards of expectation that are clearly defined, giving me guidelines to know what is supposed to be done so I can achieve it. Without a set of clear instructions, I am absolutely clueless.
Transitioning to Work from Home
As my health began deteriorating rapidly, I concluded that the best thing to do for work and income would be to work from home. I have spent the past three years teaching myself everything there is to know about graphic design, web design, and all things design in between. I learned it all and became quite good at design. The problem arose once I obtained an amazing creative business coach who encouraged me to get going and work with real clients. Unfortunately, this led to one of the most severe “autistic meltdowns” I have ever experienced.
A Devastating Meltdown
At the time, I was not considering the possibility of having autism, so I just assumed it was a very intense panic attack. In short, after sending the client initial edits for approval, they didn’t respond immediately. It was late at night (as I am a night owl), which turned out to be the reason they didn’t respond, but that thought didn’t enter my head at all. I immediately assumed they hated the designs I had sent them and spiraled into a deep panic that ended with me on the bathroom floor, losing my vision, and not even being able to see my phone to text my creative coach for help.
Forced to Ask for Help
My boyfriend had to call her and tell her I was non-functioning at the moment (as I literally couldn’t put a clear sentence together), and my coach had to jump in and complete the project for me. Since then, I have been terrified of engaging with real-world clients and have no idea how to turn this new life skill into a career that provides financial stability.
My Personal Relationship Effects
Another significant piece of this puzzle for me is the impact my illness has had on my personal relationships. When you constantly express pain and sickness, those words can become a source of annoyance for others. I’ve realized that the more frequently you mention your pain, the less it is heard and believed. This is particularly true within my support system. Simply stating that I am always in pain or don’t feel well does not convey the extent of my suffering. Instead, it often prompts people to dismiss my complaints as mere attention-seeking, resulting in a lack of support and understanding.
This situation can be further complicated when finances are involved. In December 2019, I had a difficult conversation with my mom about my inability to continue working due to severe health issues, including vomiting every day on the way to and from work. My mom generously offered to provide financial support while I sought medical help to determine the root of my problems and find a solution.
Unfortunately, I now realize that my mom never truly believed me, and her skepticism persists to this day. Since our agreement, I have diligently fulfilled my end of the bargain. I have dedicated every moment of my time to figuring out how to generate income and live a simple life. There hasn’t been a single day where I haven’t actively pursued starting a business or career. However, I have struggled immensely with communicating and socializing with anyone, which has hindered my progress.
For the past three years, I have been housebound and unable to communicate with anyone besides my boyfriend. I do not engage in texting, calling, emailing, or any form of communication with other human beings. This lack of interaction has led to a complete breakdown in my relationship with my mom. She perceives me as selfish, entitled, ungrateful, and inconsiderate because I do not engage with her more. Her belief is that if she provides financial assistance, I owe her something in return

3/3 Required
Criteria A
Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, as manifested by the following, currently or by history
(examples are illustrative, not exhaustive; see text):
1
Deficits in socialemotional reciprocity, ranging, for example, from abnormal social approach and failure of normal backandforth conversation; to reduced sharing of interests, emotions, or affect; to failure to initiate or respond to social interactions.
Required
2
Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, ranging, for example, from poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal communication; to abnormalities in eye contact and body language or deficits in understanding and use of gestures; to a total lack of facial expressions and nonverbal communication.
Required
3
Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understand relationships, ranging, for example, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts; to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making friends; to absence of interest in peers.
Required
Criteria A
Consists of the
interpersonal aspects of autism
You need to check all 3 A criteria to get a diagnosis.
A1 asks if your social interaction is neurotypical
Deficits in socialemotional reciprocity; ranging from abnormal social approach and failure of normal back and forth conversation through reduced sharing of interests, emotions, and affect and response to total lack of initiation of social interaction.[6]
You might behave differently in social settings than what is expected by society. For instance, when meeting someone for the first time, you launch into a monologue about yourself or one of your interests. Or, as an adult, you might mask but still struggle to maintain conversations built around small talk rather than indepth discussions.
Do you like/love small talk?
Do you use small talk to indicate your class, education, income, religion, and political views without saying it directly?
Do you like being in social gatherings for extended periods?
Do you prefer speaking superficially and generally, rather than about your areas of interest?
Do you choose to hang out and socialize with people rather than interact for a purpose?
Artboard 254

A2 asks about differences in eye contact,
voice, body language
Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction; ranging from poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal communication, through abnormalities in eye contact and body language, or deficits in understanding and use of nonverbal communication, to total lack of facial expression or gestures.[7]
Here we are talking about body language, facial expressions, vocal timbre, pitch, and volume. You might not like eye contact, or you might stare. You might smile or laugh at times when something makes you sad. You might have a hard time reading others’ body language and knowing what they are feeling. You may be able to, but it will be a skill you’ve acquired and not something you know intuitively.
You also might make silly voices or find that you are talking too loud or too soft. I find this out when people turn and stare at me, and my son says, ‘Mom, you are talking too loud.’
If you said NO to most of these bullet points, ya ain’t behaving like a neurotypical, and you check the boxes for autism.
A3 asks if you have differences in your relationships
Deficits in developing and maintaining relationships, appropriate to developmental level (beyond those with caregivers); ranging from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit different social contexts through difficulties in sharing imaginative play and in making friends to an apparent absence of interest in people.[8]
Generally, by the time you reach adulthood, it becomes harder to make and keep friends. For example, suppose you tick A1 and A2. In that case, you will also tick A3 because if you struggle to communicate verbally and nonverbally, it will be harder to make and keep neurotypical friends.
For example, it can be tough to know when a person is a true friend and not just saying that they are a friend; or if someone is flirting with you or not.
Beth Personal comments on Criteria A1
Beth
A1: Deficits in social and emotional reciprocity
I
have struggled my entire life feeling as though I am not being heard or listened to. I get really frustrated in conversations because I feel like I always have intelligent and relevant information to add but I can not ever seem to find a proper way to actually join a conversation. I often get frustrated and just say, “Well I guess no one is interested in what I have to say” and then people perceive me as rude and I just give up.
T
his issue has also led me to have a MAJOR fear of phone calls, avoiding them at all costs. This again is perceived as rude, forgetful, insensitive, selfish, etc when the reality is that if I know I need to make a phone call, I will obsess about it as long as I possibly can (sometimes too long making me miss the whole call in the first place), and then I will have actual physical symptoms that basically make it unbearable to even dial a number. My heart races, my whole body starts sweating, my mouth becomes insanely dry, I start shaking all over, often leading to nausea & vomiting, and I typically completely forget everything I was needing to say even though it has been rehearsed and memorized. I often feel frustrated after any phone conversation at my lack of success in communicating my thoughts and/or needs. I had a therapist once suggest in college that I had “phone anxiety” as if that were a thing.

have also for sure been known to “info dump”, especially if one of my favorite topic comes up. I can’t seem to stop myself from getting so excited about things I am knowledgeable about and tend to go on an on and again and I have been told my entire that this characteristic makes me horrible, selfish, and inconsiderate when in fact that couldn’t be further from the truth. I get so excited when someone I am speaking with also likes something I like and I want to basically fan girl about the thing with them and then I am told to be quiet and that I am being selfish and I never understand how. This leads me to obsessively worry in most social situations as I fear I will talk to much and annoy everyone.
A
s far as social gatherings go, no I do not enjoy that at all. I definitely pretend to enjoy them when I was younger but quickly learned it became much easier when under the influence of some sort of mind altering substance so that was one was to cope for a while and then as I grew older, I just always knew where the closest bathroom was so I could get away for a minute alone.
I
t is well known that I spent every single birthday crying in some bathroom somehow some way. At younger birthday parties, I always felt like my friends wanted to hang out with my sister more than me and I would get upset and as I grew older it was mostly a matter of feeling too insecure and ugly. I always explained it the same way I explain to people why I am not married. I have been in a relationship for ten plus years but the idea of a wedding sounds like my
absolute worst nightmare
.
H
ere’s why. To have an entire day, or multiple days usually with showers and rehearsals, etc, where all of the attention is on you and everyone is trying to talk to you and look at you sounds completely utterly horrifying to me. Anytime I perceive I may be the center of attention, aka my birthdays, I would freak out and end up crying in the bathroom. Growing up my best friend was 13 months older than me and basically told me when, where, and how to do everything. From around the third grade until I graduated high school, I made her walk EVERYWHERE with me. I would not go to the bathroom in a public restaurant alone, I wouldn’t walk into a store alone, and really anywhere else because in my head I thought everyone would look at her because she was taller and blonder than me. She was the oldest sibling to much younger other siblings and naturally was pretty bossy and that worked out just fine for me since I couldn’t make decisions most of the time for myself.
M
aking friends was always extremely difficult for me and I have yet to ever figure out how to maintain a friendship. I currently have
zero
friends and really only remember having “friends” in high school and in college but I never really felt I belonged. I managed to forge “surface friendships” with some co workers at a couple jobs but I never felt comfortable being social with them outside of work now did I maintain any of those relationships once that job ended or once of us left.
I
didn’t understand how people could manage “hanging out” with other people, especially other females. I learned very early on that I was attractive and that if I showed up and looked pretty than most people would like me and that would suffice. This led me naturally as I grew older to tend to hang out with way more males than females because what group of horny teenage guys doesn’t want the pretty girl hanging around, even if she is kind of weird and annoying.
M
y looks definitely were a part of my mask way before I knew what masking meant (which has only been a couple month now). I carry a ton of frustration over this subject because I feel my parents quickly put me in that box and none of my other attributes were nurtured or encouraged. I am bitter over the fact that I feel my intelligence is by far one of my best strengths but intelligence was not valued or rewarded in my household. What was rewarded, and still is what is demanded and rewarded, is that you show up and don’t disrupt the status quo. Meaning, show up, look pretty, keep your mouth shut, smile, laugh and leave. I have had these words said to me verbatim countless time in my life. Even recently one of the reasons my communication with my mom is so strained is that this is precisely what she told me the last time we really talked and I haven’t really made an effort to engage ever since.
[Christmas 2022 Incident]
I
do not really recall too many friendships in my childhood but there were definitely some here and there for sure. I had one really close friend all throughout life that was again very much the domineering one in our friendship and between her and my older sister, I really didn’t have to make many decisions or choices due to their “eldest daughter” tendencies to take charge. I spent countless lunches in bathrooms throughout life and at my last job in restaurant management I was constantly being reprimanded for going to the bathroom too often. I remember enjoying talking to my teachers more than my peers on several occasions and always feeling very different than everyone else even though people always misjudged me based on my appearance. Again as soon as I hit 13, most of my time was spent with boys as they were much easier to please but of course this led to multiple abusive and toxic relationships throughout my entire life and not being able to handle rejection at all. I can now see in hindsight once again that I missed many glaring red flags and obvious dangers and ended up in situations that I was manipulated, taken advantage of, and traumatized.
M
y dad had some crazy sports car in the 1990s and he kept a car cover on it. I used to love going and hiding under the car cover where no one knew where I was and sitting in the peace and quiet (and heat!).
A
s I have aged and matured, my desire to be social has continued to diminish to the state it is now where I have zero desire to be social at any level. As will be a theme throughout this documentation, I feel as a child and younger tween/teen, I copied what others around me did and was very keen on pleasing my parents and those around me. I am a master at walking into a situation and knowing what is “expected” of me and my behavior and then I will control myself accordingly. I don’t recall any social situation every being relaxing or a time where my brain wasn’t on overdrive obsessing over weather or not I was doing the right thing at the right time.
T
he last thing worth mentioning is that I have never once felt comfortable in a social setting. I developed a habit early in life of staying up over night or all night because that was the only time I could relax and actually focus, do homework, do work, eat, or even exercise. In high school I would wake up in the middle of the night and do a regimented workout routine every night, in college I would stay up all night and do any major homework or project; famously being known for writing a 25 page thesis with sources in 24 hours and getting an A; and now this habit has become more routine than habit as I often stay up overnight to get any work done and clean my house. I never knew why but always just tried to explain to my boyfriend that for some reason during the day when he and my dog were both awake, I could not relax and not worry about what they were doing and what they may need. I recently read somewhere that this is something autistics commonly due as it is the only time that they can truly unmask and that totally makes sense to me. It is like I have never been able to stop “scanning my surroundings” and picking up on other people’s energy while other people are awake so as soon as everyone else is in a deep sleep, I come alive and thrive. I currently stay up overnight at least 2 nights per week and it is my absolute favorite time ever. I know it isn’t good for my health to lose sleep, but I truly find it so hard to be productive in any way if anyone else is awake in my house, dog included (he is also very needy, demanding, and a dachshund that loves to bark which doesn’t help my anxiety).
A2 asks about differences in eye contact,
voice, body language
I
think this area is one is which my masking was particularly skilled. Early on in childhood I had some behaviors that I quickly learned were weird or not socially acceptable and I quickly found hidden other, hidden, ways to manage my anxiety. I am not sure when it started but at some point in my life I became pretty obsessed with eye contact. I have very light and very bright blue eyes and people almost always noticed them or said something about them. I found that if I just opened my eyes a little bit extra and slightly stared into someones eyes that I got a favorable response. I practiced and nurtured this skill constantly. I would stare at teachers directly in the eye while they were talking to see if they noticed or I could get a response. As I have aged, I have noticed that when I stare someone directly into the eyes, It’s almost like my brain turns fuzzy and I can’t focus on what they are saying anymore. I especially find this difficult with zoom calls and Online meetings where you have to stare at yourself or someone else straight in the face and I have extreme anxiety over Online meetings and tend to completely be unable to focus.
I
also had a habit of sitting and staring with my mouth wide open. I was told by many people this made me look “stupid” or another negative adjectives and constantly trying to not do it. I eventually learned I couldn’t breathe out of my nose at all and had sinus surgery to make sure I could keep my mouth closed.
I
was very into gymnastics as a child so I was constantly moving and stretching and doing gymnastics in some way. I also for some strange reason did Jane Fonda workout videos like a madwomen starting in Kindergarten and was always moving my body in one way or another. I think this was my way of “stimming” in a more socially acceptable way.
A
s a child I would suck on bubblegum obsessively (basically push it to the roof of my mouth and suck on it with my tongue) and rub my mom’s elbows, the crease between her thumb and pointer finger, or anywhere there were wrinkles (I used to love visiting my granny so I could rub the wrinkles in the crease of her thumb and fingers). My mom and my granny were the only people I would do this to and I vividly remember being terrified of growing up or getting older to where I would have to go places alone without my mom and I wouldn’t have anything to rub. I don’t know when exactly I stopped this habit but I remember being made fun of for it a lot.
I
also would chew holes in all of the ends of my long sleeve tee shirts and sweatshirts or chew holes around the collar or neck of a shirt. I would suck on my hair often and I had a blankey until I was 13 years old and was devastated when I left it in a hotel in LA on a church missions trip.
I
developed a habit of popping my knuckles, ALOT, when in conversation with people. I think it was a way to STIM with my hands that was more socially acceptable. I found as I got older that I would even make the motions of popping my knuckles without actually popping them. I also tap my fingers in the air alot and find myself sitting on my hands in meetings or in public group settings to avoid them doing weird things.
A
s far as body language goes, I would say I definitely do what I call is “the turtle” alot. I tend to grab my shoulders and hunch inwards and try to make myself small and disappear. In times of extreme distress (mostly at the height of a very emotional argument with an abusive ex) I would claw, scratch, and scrape at my arms to draw blood. I also would dig my fingernails into parts of my body when i got nervous all the time until I would see indentions and that somehow calmed my anxiety. I also would bite all the skin around my fingers and bite my fingernails. I eventually started getting artificial nails all through high school and college as a way to make me not bite my nails.

Beth Personal comments on Criteria B
Beth
B1: Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements
I
am going too just start listing out traits that fit in Criteria B and then I will try to indicate what part of Criteria B they relate to versus trying to list them out by category because that for some reason makes sense to my brain. So here they are.
I
n terms of stimming, I didn’t even know the term or what it meant until recently. I truly believe my ability to mask and my desperate desire to gain everyone’s approval was my guiding light so anytime a behavior or habit was discouraged or made fun of, I very quickly stopped doing it no matter what. I am also hoping to find out more details about my younger childhood that I don’t remember but as of right now I do not have those details to fill in the blanks from my early days.
I
know that I had the whole bubblegum addiction and sucked my gum while rubbing on my mom’s skin wrinkles. I would get bubblegum, and I do remember it had to be a certain brand and kind, and instead of chew it, I would push it to the roof of my mouth and push my tongue against it in a sucking manner. When I did this I would want to sit with my mom and rub her elbows or the creases between her fingers (where skin wrinkles were). I was always terrified that if I had to grow up and stop doing this habit, that I wouldn’t be able to function. I don’t remember how or when it stopped but I do know I got made fun of for it and everyone was always warning me of damaging my mouth and getting “bucked teeth” if I kept doing it.
I
used to sleep with my older sister as often as I could when I was a child. I was deathly afraid of the dark and being alone. I also was obsessed with stuffed animals. I would sleep with all of them piled on top of me because I thought it provided some sort of Armour or protection against the bad guys. I quickly realized I had to come up with a system for this layering of stuffed animals because I started getting anxiety that some of my stuffed animals would feel left out if they weren’t the ones that got to sleep closest to me. I got a stack of index cards and wrote the name of each stuffed animal on a card. I then got a little storage box for the cards and would let the stuffed animal that was on the first card sleep with me that night and then move the card to the back and that way all my stuffed animals would feel equally loved and wanted.
J
ust a funny random tid bit to add is that I notoriously feel asleep at night with gum in my mouth (because I ALWAYS had gum in my mouth) and it would always get tangled in my hair so I had a special little dish (I think it was technically a ring holder) that I kept on my bedside table at night to try to entice me to take my gum out.
I
n terms of actual stimming, again I didn’t even know what that was until now, but I have always moved my hands and fingers ALOT. I do the “air piano” think often where I am tapping my fingers in the air. I also can not sit still very well most times but in the same sense have problem if I am deeply into a special interest of not moving at all for too long in a detrimental way to my health and awareness of my body’s needs. I have found that I will often sit on my hands in more formal or social situations in an attempt to hide their movements. I was also joked for always “talking with my hands” so I tried to control it.
I
also would often suck on my hair. I would take small chunks of it and suck on them in my mouth. I am seeing a trend here with oral fixations and I think I substituted other “objects” throughout life to accommodate for this. I was a smoker when I was younger and I really believe that was an effort to accommodate my need to social breaks and oral fixation. I quickly learned that smokers get to take breaks alone outside and I loved that. I always had a tendency to chew on things, all things really until my severe dental issues arose and the process of losing my teeth has caused me to longer chew things obviously.
T
his has been an issue for me the past couple years as I have gotten dentures and have not found a way to wear them comfortably as I can not stand them in my mouth and it gives me major anxiety when something is covering the roof of my mouth. I wonder often if I still do the gum sucking thing unconsciously and place my tongue on the roof of my mouth and I can’t do that with my dentures in. I had my teeth pulled 3 years ago and have yet to ever wear them for more than a couple hours, which has made my isolation from society worse.
O
nce I started researching autism more after believing I had it, I discovered what Echolalia is and I definitely have that. I repeat everything, always have and it drives people crazy. I try really hard not to do it but I do. I have more awareness of it now obviously and catch myself doing it ecspeically bad when talking to my dog (which I do all day long). I don’t know why but I repeat almost everything I say to him twice. In conversations I find myself trying to control it and finding ways to say the same thing twice without it being to obvious so I am always tracking what I say and if it is new material or a repeat in every c0nversation.

Criteria C,D, & E
1
Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (but may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities, or may be masked by learned strategies in later life).
1
Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning.
1
These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental delay. Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder frequently cooccur; to make comorbid diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, social communication should be below that expected for general developmental level.
Criteria C
Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (but may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities, or may be masked by learned strategies in later life)
Criterion C is simply about whether the traits of criteria A and B were present since childhood. Autism is lifelong, and present since/before birth.
This also means that if the observed traits were not present as a child, something other than autism may account for them.
Criteria D
Criterion D is about whether your autistic traits affect
your daily functioning; whether everything from criteria
A and B causes clinically significant challenges in
social, occupational, or other
important areas of current functioning.
Support Level
Social Communication
Restricted interests & Repetitive Behaviors
Level 1
Requiring Support
Without supports in place, deficits in social communication cause noticeable challenges. Has difficulty initiating social interactions and demonstrates clear examples of atypical or unsuccessful responses to social overtures of others. May appear to have decreased interest in social interactions.
Restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) cause significant interference with functioning in one or more contexts. Resists attempts by others to interrupt RRBs or to be redirected from fixated interests.
Level 2
Requiring Substantial Support
Marked challenges in verbal and nonverbal social communication; social challenges apparent even with supports in place; limited initiation of social interactions and reduced or abnormal response to social overtures from others.
Restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) and/or preoccupations or fixated interests appear frequently enough to be obvious to the casual observer and interfere with functioning in a variety of contexts. Distress or frustration is apparent when RRBs are interrupted; difficult to redirect from fixated interests.
Level 3
Requiring VERY Substantial Support
Severe challenges in verbal and nonverbal social communication significantly impact daily functioning; very limited initiation of social interactions and minimal response to social overtures from others.
Preoccupations, fixated rituals and/or repetitive behaviors markedly interfere with functioning in all spheres. Marked distress when rituals or routines are interrupted; very difficult to redirect from fixated interests or returns to it quickly.
Criteria E
These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental delay. Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder frequently cooccur; to make comorbid diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, social communication should be below that expected for general developmental level
Summary
A
Challenges in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, as manifested by the following, currently or by history:
Do you socialize and communicate like a neurotypical?
1
Challenges in socialemotional reciprocity (e.g. differences in social approach; failure of normal backandforth conversation; reduced sharing of interests, emotions, or affect; failure to initiate or respond to social interactions).
With respect to social interaction, do you respond to others in a neuronormative way?
2
Challenges in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction (e.g. poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal communication; differences in eye contact and body language or challenges in understanding and using gestures; a lack of facial expressions and nonverbal communication).
With respect to body language, do you respond to others in a neuronormative way?
3
Challenges with developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships (e.g. difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts; difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making friends; absence of interest in peers).
Are you able to maintain relationships and adapt to social circumstances?
B
Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, as manifested by at least two of the following, currently or by history:
Do you have the skills required to be a neurotypical?
1
Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech (e.g., simple motor stereotypes, lining up toys or flipping objects, echolalia, idiosyncratic phrases).
Do you display selfsoothing or selfstimulating behaviors (i.e. stimming)?
2
Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behavior (e.g., extreme distress at small changes, difficulties with transitions, rigid thinking patterns, greeting rituals, need to take the same route or eat the same food every day).
Do you like routine and consistency, and is it challenging for you when your routine or plans unexpectedly change?
3
Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g., strong attachment to or preoccupation with unusual objects, excessively circumscribed or perseverative interests).
Do you have special interests; things that you want—no, need—to know everything about?
4
Hyper or hyperactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment (e.g. apparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, visual fascination with lights or movement).
Do you find you are oversensitive to light, touch, smells, or certain textures? And do you experience any undersensitivities?
C
Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (but may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities, or may be masked by learned strategies in later life).
You have had the aforementioned traits since you were a child.
D
Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning.
Your traits affect your daily life interacting in the neurotypical world.
E
These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental delay. Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder frequently cooccur; to make comorbid diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, social communication should be below that expected for general developmental level.

The Autism Quotient (AQ)
(AQ)
What does my score mean?
The AQ doesn’t really offer much insight into specific autistic traits, as it only outputs a single score.
Any scores of 26 or greater indicate the presence of autistic traits
; the higher the score, the more autistic traits you have.
Furthermore, 79.3% of autistic people score 32 or higher (whereas only 2% of controls do),
so scores of 32 and above are particularly significant.
The AQ is particularly sensitive in distinguishing between autistic and nonautistic adult females, as
92.3% of autistic females scored 32 or higher
(compared to 1% of the control group).[9]
Do note that no single test is conclusive, and not every autistic person necessarily scores above the defined threshold on each test. If you score low on the AQ but still think you could be autistic, try taking a few other autism tests.

May
copy, mimic or clone herself on other girls, also known as “Social Echolalia”
, a mirroring of other children, giving her a superficial social confidence and skillset by acting the part of another person. However, the complexities of the next step of unwritten social skills soon becomes apparent when she has to navigate the expectations and demands that come with reciprocal relationships and maintaining them. This is both confusing and exhausting for her.
May have imaginary friends and/or imaginary animals

She may dominate when playing or talking with other girls OR be passive, quiet and “invisible” within the group.
If she is dominating, her play tends to appear to be shared with others but she dominates and insists that others follows her rules and themes. If and/or when others refuse to be engaged she continues on with her own ideas or play. Her play tends to be mostly repetitive. If she is passive, she’s more likely to be compliant and may not come across as having social impairments.
She
may also be shy, embarrassed, coy, naive, innocent, unassuming, and hide or “camouflage” her difficulties,
even lying about whether she needs or understands something or needs assistance or help. She is most likely to be described as “flying under the radar” or “blending in with the walls”.

. It is this part that often girls find stressful and they will often ruminate about the social situation, what they could have said or done differently, often late at night
She may appear to have a rich imaginative world but the quality is atypical, tending to be a blend of fantasy and reality. This is currently see in the transgender trend. Before that it was usually seen with the anime, manga trends, pretending to be animals, pretending to have imaginary relationships with others.

. This can get them into trouble at times for hurting others or taking revenge. May obsess over or stalk people. May have a misguided sense of justice that leads them to getting in trouble with other people, lawyers or the legal system/law. An obsession with a human/humans never leads anywhere good (except if a detective after a terrorist).

and may be mean to her, ostracize her and/or make fun of her, taking advantage of her naivety. She may appear to “flitter” from one person to the other or one group to the other, unable to have a typical friendship, due to smothering people or groups. Her peers take advantage of her, make fun of her and/or will be mean to her, saying they are her friend one day, but their actions prove otherwise. The issues revolve around girls being mean to her and cutting her from the group.

May have
Alexithymia, an inability to identify and describe emotions in the self
People with
mirrortouch synesthesia
may experience heightened empathy due to increased activation of mirror systems in their brain. Research by Michael Banissy et al. found that these individuals score higher in emotional reactivity on the empathy quotient (EQ) but not in cognitive empathy or social skills. This suggests that empathy is multifaceted and not solely dependent on the tactile mirror system.

joint hypermobility syndrome
Joint Hypermobility Sundrome
&
Ehler Danlos heds
Hypermobility Syndrome, also known as Joint Hypermobility Syndrome (JHS), is a condition characterized by joints that easily move beyond the normal range expected for a particular joint. This condition can lead to various musculoskeletal issues, including chronic pain, joint instability, and an increased risk of dislocations.
Scientific Description
Hypermobility Syndrome is often due to inherited variations in collagen, a protein that provides structure and strength to connective tissues throughout the body. The most common form of this condition is the hypermobile type of EhlersDanlos Syndrome (hEDS), which is part of a group of connective tissue disorders known for hypermobility.
Key features of Hypermobility Syndrome include:
Joint Laxity:
This refers to the looseness of joints, allowing them to extend beyond the typical range of motion. It can affect both large and small joints.
Chronic Pain:
Individuals often experience persistent musculoskeletal pain, which can be widespread and disabling.
Frequent Injuries:
The instability of hypermobile joints makes them prone to sprains, strains, subluxations (partial dislocations), and complete dislocations.
Muscle Fatigue:
Due to the extra effort required to stabilize loose joints, muscles may become easily fatigued and overworked.
Other Systemic Symptoms:
Some individuals may experience additional symptoms such as gastrointestinal issues, autonomic dysfunction (e.g., POTS  Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome), and skin that is more elastic than usual.
Diagnosis and Management
Diagnosis is typically made through a combination of clinical examination and patient history, focusing on the Beighton score, a system used to measure the extent of joint hypermobility. Genetic testing may be conducted if a specific connective tissue disorder like EDS is suspected.
Management strategies often include:
Physical Therapy:
Focused on strengthening the muscles around the joints to improve stability.
Pain Management:
This can include medications, lifestyle modifications, and sometimes interventions like bracing or orthotics.
Patient Education:
Teaching patients about joint protection techniques and the importance of avoiding activities that could exacerbate joint instability.

EhlersDanlos Syndrome (EDS)
Overview and Rheumatology Relevance
Ehlers
Danlos Syndrome
(EDS)
EhlersDanlos Syndrome (EDS) is a group of connective tissue disorders characterized by various abnormalities in collagen synthesis, leading to a spectrum of clinical manifestations.
These manifestations primarily affect the skin, joints, and vascular system.
Classification and Types
The most common types include:
Classical EDS
(cEDS)
Characterized by skin hyperextensibility, atrophic scarring, and joint hypermobility.
Mutations typically involve the COL5A1 or COL5A2 genes.
Hypermobility EDS
(hEDS)
Predominantly features joint hypermobility and associated musculoskeletal complications.
The genetic basis is not welldefined.
Vascular EDS
(vEDS)
Characterized by vascular fragility, leading to a risk of arterial rupture, and thin, translucent skin.
It is usually due to mutations in the COL3A1 gene.
Kyphoscoliotic EDS
(kEDS)
Presents with congenital scoliosis, severe muscle hypotonia,
and joint laxity.
It is caused by mutations in the
PLOD1 gene.
EDS is classified into several types based on clinical features and genetic mutations.
The Beighton Test for Hypermobiity
The Beighton Test for Hypermobiity
EDS Pathophysiology & clinical manifestations
Pathophysiology
EDS results from defects in collagen and connective tissue components, leading to increased tissue fragility. The specific pathophysiology varies with the type of EDS, depending on the specific collagen involved and the nature of the genetic mutation.
Clinical Manifestations
Key features relevant to rheumatology include:
Joint Hypermobility:
Generalized Joint Hypermobility (GJH): A hallmark of hEDS, it can lead to frequent dislocations, subluxations, and chronic joint pain.
Arthralgia: Chronic joint pain is common, often disproportionate to physical findings.
Skin Manifestations:
Skin Hyperextensibility: Easily stretchable skin that returns to normal when released.
Atrophic Scarring: Scars that appear wide and thin.
Musculoskeletal Complications:
Chronic Pain: Often multifactorial, including joint instability, muscle pain, and fibromyalgialike symptoms.
Myopathy: Muscle weakness and hypotonia can be seen, especially in kEDS.
Deformities: Scoliosis, kyphosis, and other spinal deformities may occur, particularly in kEDS.
Cardiovascular Involvement:
Aneurysms and Dissections: Particularly in vEDS, there is a high risk of arterial rupture, which requires vigilance.
Other Systemic Manifestations:
Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, dysmotility, and hernias.
Neurological: Proprioception issues and autonomic dysfunction (e.g., POTS  Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome).
Diagnosis
Clinical Evaluation:
Detailed history and physical examination focusing on joint hypermobility (Beighton score), skin features, and family history.
Genetic Testing:
Identification of specific mutations (COL5A1, COL5A2, COL3A1, etc.) Helps confirm the diagnosis and classify the type of EDS.
Imaging and Other Tests:
MRI or ultrasound may be used to assess joint and vascular abnormalities.
Management in Rheumatology
Multidisciplinary Approach:
Collaboration with geneticists, cardiologists, orthopedists, and pain specialists is essential.
Pain Management:
Pharmacologic: NSAIDs, analgesics, and occasionally lowdose tricyclic antidepressants or gabapentinoids.
NonPharmacologic: Physical therapy focusing on strengthening, proprioception, and joint stabilization.
Joint Protection:
Use of braces, taping, and avoiding highimpact activities to reduce dislocations and injuries.
Surgical Considerations:
Surgery is approached with caution due to poor wound healing and increased risk of complications.
Monitoring for Complications:
Regular cardiovascular assessment for vEDS, including imaging to detect aneurysms or arterial dissections early.
Prognosis
The prognosis varies widely depending on the type of EDS.
vEDS has the highest morbidity due to vascular complications.
Chronic pain and joint issues significantly impact the quality of life in hEDS and cEDS.
Key Points for Rheumatology
Early Recognition: Identifying EDS early helps in managing symptoms and preventing complications.
Comprehensive Care: A holistic approach addressing pain, joint stability, and psychological support is crucial.
Patient Education: Educating patients about their condition, activity modifications, and when to seek medical attention is essential.
Conclusion
EDS is a complex, multisystem disorder with significant implications for rheumatology due to its impact on joints and connective tissue. Understanding its clinical presentation, diagnostic criteria, and management strategies is crucial for providing comprehensive care to affected patients.
EDS Diagnosis & Management
Correlation Between EDS & ASD
Correlation Between
EhlersDanlos Syndrome (EDS) & Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
Recent research has suggested a potential correlation between EhlersDanlos Syndrome (EDS) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). While the exact nature of this relationship is not fully understood, several studies have indicated that individuals with EDS may have a higher prevalence of ASD compared to the general population.
Overview of Correlation
Clinical Observations:
Behavioral Overlap: Both EDS and ASD patients often exhibit sensory processing abnormalities, anxiety, and gastrointestinal issues.
Family Studies: Some familial studies suggest a higher incidence of ASD traits among relatives of individuals with EDS, indicating a possible genetic link.
Shared Genetic Factors:
Collagen and Connective Tissue Genes: Mutations in genes involved in collagen synthesis and connective tissue integrity, such as those seen in EDS, may also play a role in neurodevelopmental processes.
Neurodevelopmental Genes: There is ongoing research into whether mutations that affect connective tissue might also influence brain development and function, potentially contributing to ASD.
Research Data and Findings
Prevalence Studies:
Increased ASD Prevalence: Studies have found that the prevalence of ASD in individuals with EDS is higher than in the general population. For example, a study published in the journal “Molecular Autism” in 2018 reported that approximately 2040% of individuals with hypermobility syndromes, including EDS, also have ASD or ASD traits.
Comorbid Diagnoses: Another study indicated that children with hypermobility spectrum disorders were more likely to receive an ASD diagnosis compared to the general pediatric population.
Symptom Overlap:
Sensory Sensitivities: Both EDS and ASD patients frequently report heightened sensitivity to sensory stimuli, such as sound, light, and touch.
Anxiety and Mood Disorders: There is a significant overlap in the incidence of anxiety and mood disorders among patients with EDS and those with ASD.
Gastrointestinal Issues: Gastrointestinal dysmotility, a common feature in EDS, is also prevalent in individuals with ASD.
Mechanistic Hypotheses:
Connective Tissue Influence on Brain Development: Some researchers hypothesize that abnormalities in connective tissue could affect brain development and function, possibly leading to neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD.
Neuroinflammation and Immune Dysregulation: Both EDS and ASD have been associated with immune dysregulation and neuroinflammation, suggesting a possible shared pathway.
Implications for Clinical Practice
Holistic Management:
Interdisciplinary Care: Patients with EDS who also have ASD benefit from coordinated care involving rheumatologists, neurologists, psychologists, and gastroenterologists.
Tailored Therapies: Treatment plans should consider both connective tissue issues and neurodevelopmental needs, emphasizing sensory integration therapy, physical therapy, and behavioral interventions.
Awareness and Screening:
Routine Screening: Clinicians should consider screening for ASD in patients diagnosed with EDS, particularly those exhibiting neurodevelopmental or sensory symptoms.
Early Intervention: Early identification of ASD in EDS patients allows for timely intervention and support, potentially improving overall outcomes.
