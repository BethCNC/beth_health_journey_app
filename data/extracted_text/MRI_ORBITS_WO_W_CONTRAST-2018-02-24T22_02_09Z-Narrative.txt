HISTORY: Proptosis.


COMPARISON: None.


Multisequence, multiplanar images were performed on a high field MRI through the orbits before and after the uneventful ministration of 6 cc Gadavist IV.


There is slight orbital asymmetry with the right globe protruding further than the left. I see no intra or extraconal mass lesion to account for this, and the orbital fat is preserved. The extraocular muscles are unremarkable. Slight asymmetric inward 
bowing of the left medial orbital wall suggests a possible remote left orbital injury. There is also opacification of a left posterior ethmoid cell with opacification of adjacent portions of a septated left sphenoid cell. Mild mucosal thickening is seen 
elsewhere within the ethmoids. No fluid level.


The visualized intracranial structures are unremarkable.
