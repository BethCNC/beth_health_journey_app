MRI CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST


TECHNIQUE: Multiple T1 and T2 weighted MR images were obtained


PROVIDED CLINICAL INFORMATION: M50.322-Other cervical disc degeneration at C5-C6 level Right C6 radiculopathy with wrist extensor and shoulder girdle weakness on exam
ADDITIONAL CLINICAL INFORMATION: None available


COMPARISON: Radiograph 6/5/2018.


INTERPRETATION:


There is mild reversal of normal lordosis, but no focal malalignment. There is no fracture or marrow replacing process. Posterior elements are intact. The odontoid and C1-C2 relationship is normal. Cervical medullary junction is normal. The spinal cord 
is normal size and signal intensity. The paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable.


C1-2: No abnormality.


C2-3: No significant central canal or foraminal stenosis.


C3-4: No significant central canal or foraminal stenosis.


C4-5: There is shallow right paramedian disc protrusion with annular fissuring effacing the right ventral thecal sac and ventral spinal cord surface. There is mild degree of canal stenosis. The cord is not displaced posteriorly or impinged. There is no 
foraminal stenosis.


C5-6: There is moderate disc space narrowing with posterior lateral marginal osteophyte/disc complex with right greater than left uncovertebral joint osteophyte. There is effacement of the ventral aspect of the thecal sac. There is contacted, but no 
effacement of the ventral cord surface. There is mild degree of canal stenosis. There is moderate right, but no left foraminal stenosis.


C6-7: No significant central canal or foraminal stenosis.


C7-T1: No significant central canal or foraminal stenosis.


There is no significant stenosis at the visualized upper thoracic disc spaces.
