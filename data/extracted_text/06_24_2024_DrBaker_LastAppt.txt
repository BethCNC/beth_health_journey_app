Subjective
Patient
ID:
Jennifer
Beth
Cartrette
is
a
41
y.o.
female.
Chief
Complaint
Patient
presents
with
•
Follow-up
HPI
Rheumatology
History:
Ms.
Cartrette
is
a
pleasant
F
with
a
PMH
of
bipolar
d/o,
ADHD,
PTSD,
anorexia,
and
presumptive
PsA
here
for
continued
evaluation
and
management
of
joint
pain.
Initial
consultation
with
myself
was
pursued
on
6/6/2023
Notably,
she
has
previously
followed
with
rheumatology
evaluation,
last
following
with
Dr.
Patel
(Novant
-
LOV
9/2022).
She
mentioned
following
since
2019
for
ongoing
widespread
pain
with
emphasis
at
the
level
of
the
hands/wrists,
upper
neck,
lower
back,
hips,
knees,
ankles,
and
feet.
Pain
can
really
be
at
anytime
of
day,
but
she
does
wonder
about
worsening
symptoms
early
in
the
morning
with
associated
morning
stiffness
being
upwards
of
multiple
hours.
Upon
establishing
at
Novant
initially,
notable
work-up
included
negative
ANA,
RF/CCP,
HLA-B27,
uric
acid,
CRP/ESR.
She
notably
has
a
prior
diagnosis
of
psoriatic
arthritis
based
off
of
the
work-up
and
evaluation
above
with
a
concern
about
an
underlying
inflammatory
arthritis
in
a
pattern
consistent
with
peripheral
and
axial
symptoms.
She
has
never
exhibited
symptoms
of
skin
psoriasis.
More
recently,
she
does
present
with
a
multitude
of
symptoms.
She
includes
GI
distress
including
ongoing
abdominal
pain,
bloating,
and
constipation
with
chronic
nausea.
She
also
has
a
chronic
brain
fog
and
inability
to
focus.
She
does
have
a
known
diagnosis
of
ADHD,
bipolar
disorder,
anorexia,
and
PTSD.
She
is
maintained
on
Adderall
right
now
and
is
trying
to
establish
with
behavioral
health.
She
also
has
neuropathic
symptoms
chronically
across
the
body
including
nonspecific
cramping
pain
showing
up
at
the
level
of
the
calves
in
addition
to
an
intermittent
numbness
and
tingling
showing
up
in
the
lower
extremities
in
general.
Additionally
has
"body
temperature"
changes.
Has
followed
with
ophthalmology
more
recently
and
had
an
evaluation
highly
suggestive
of
thyroid
eye
disease.
Does
have
upcoming
follow-up
with
endocrinology.
Last
TSH
was
actually
normal,
although
there
was
slightly
elevated
TPO
antibodies.
At
one
point
did
have
TSH
around
7.

Rx
History:
She
was
started
on
Humira
(7/2020),
which
was
discontinued
shortly
thereafter
(10/2020)
due
to
ongoing
skin
infections
of
the
face.
She
was
started
on
hydroxychloroquine
(3/2022)
which
was
shortly
thereafter
discontinued
(5/2022)
due
to
tinnitus.
Methotrexate
was
initiated
(5/2022),
and
intermittent
steroids
have
been
utilized
with
partial
benefit.
Methotrexate
eventually
questioned
on
efficacy
and
discontinued
(3/2024)
Interval
History:
In
the
interim,
Ms.
Cartrette
did
stop
the
methotrexate.
She
is
not
sure
it
has
had
a
dramatic
impact
on
worsening
joint
symptoms
at
all.
Does
feel
like
she
has
had
some
improvement
on
her
GI
symptoms.
Residual
pain
is
all
over
and
can
include
the
hands,
extremities,
upper
neck,
hips,
lower
back,
knees,
ankles,
and
feet.
Pain
can
really
be
at
anytime
of
day.
Sometimes,
work
tends
to
exacerbate
the
issues.
She
feels
like
she
has
a
profound
hypermobility
of
her
joints.
Has
been
doing
self
research
and
she
thinks
she
has
autism.
Additionally,
she
wonders
about
having
a
hypermobility
condition
like
EDS.
She
continues
to
have
some
"infection"
type
rashes
showing
up
and
around
the
lips
and
face.
She
continues
to
use
topical
treatments
to
try
and
benefit
this.
Other
rashes
include
intermittent
redness
across
the
palms
of
the
hands.
No
new
pattern
to
her
chest
pain;
still
gets
some
palpitations.
No
new
cough
or
shortness
of
breath.
Has
a
chronic
fatigue
and
brain
fog.
No
new
definitive
eye
inflammation.
No
fevers.

Assessment/Plan
1.
Fibromyalgia
-Previously
diagnosed
with
an
inflammatory
arthritis;
widespread
peripheral
and
axial
manifestations;
intermittent
responsiveness
to
prednisone,
but
no
response
to
DMARD
therapy
and
objective
testing
off
of
DMARD
therapy
shows
no
evidence
of
inflammation
-
Patient
does
have
a
known
history
of
PTSD
and
anorexia
related
to
childhood
trauma,
and
this
could
have
a
psychosomatic
manifestation
**At
this
point,
I
have
not
seen
any
evidence
of
inflammatory
arthritis
off
of
all
disease
modifying
therapy.
She
continues
to
have
widespread
joint
and
muscle
based
pain.
I
strongly
encourage
follow-up
with
PCP
to
work
on
treatment
of
FMS
and
mental
health
2.
Chronic
Lower
Back
Pain

--- Page 10 ---
-Notably
with
a
history
of
axial
disease
as
well;
does
have
a
history
of
cervical
fusion
already,
and
now
more
recently
with
lower
back
and
buttock
space
pain/discomfort
-
Lumbar
films
did
show
some
straightening
of
normal
lordosis
in
addition
to
some
facet
arthritis
**I
think
conservative
management
is
fine
at
this
point
3.
Joint
hypermobility
-Does
have
multiple
hypermobile
joints;
possibly
associated
with
EDS
or
an
alternative
collagen
vascular
disease
**I
defer
the
management
of
joint
hypermobility
syndromes
back
to
PCP;
we
do
not
treat
chronic
pain
associated
with
hypermobility
disorders
in
this
clinic.
Could
have
considerations
for
follow-up
with
orthopedics
and
physical
therapists
