Bipolar Disorder in Remission

After working with my psychiatrist for a couple years & really trying to understand
my bipolar diagnosis, she actually removed the diagnosis from my chart & stated it
was in remission. For several months it was not on my chart at all!

This was VERY important to me personally because | have never felt that diagnosis
was accurate. Following my kidnapping, | experienced extreme PTSD and no one
knew what to do and for their convenience, | was highly over medicated and over
diagnosed. At one point | was on 14 psych medications and diagnosed with several
mental health conditions that were all a direct result of my trauma. | was also given
large doses of lithium during this time, which has always concerned me considering
my current thyroid issues.

| have had a difficult time feeling like doctors have believed me in my past & always
thought the bi-polar diagnosis made that more complicated. My psychiatrist fully
agreed and removed it from my chart. She then quit that practice within a couple
weeks and now it is back on my chart. | just wanted to mention this as it was a prob
lem | actively sought out to fix and it appears that it is no longer fixed unfortunately.
| will be actively trying to get this corrected again
