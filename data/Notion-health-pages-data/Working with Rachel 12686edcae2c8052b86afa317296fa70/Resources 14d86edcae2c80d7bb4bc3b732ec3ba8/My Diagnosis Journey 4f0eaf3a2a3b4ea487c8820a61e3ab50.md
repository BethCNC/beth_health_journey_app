üíõ **To my mom, sister, family, and anyone else who feels neglected by me or thinks my lack of communication is due to selfish motives, I apologize. This is utterly untrue. I have been experiencing something called Autistic Burnout, which in my case has come with Selective Mutism. I am literally unable to speak to anyone. I have been physically ill just thinking about how to respond to your text messages.**

**I have learned SO much about Autism (I knew NOTHING before - and of course, I have researched it obsessively, another one of my autistic traits!). Autism is definitely one of my current "special interests," and yes, I "info dump" all about them instead of listening in conversations! That is where my autism shines ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è**

**My life has been turned completely upside down for over 4 years, but truthfully, nothing in life has been easy for me, and I always thought it was my fault. Which, if we're honest, is what I've been told. Learning that I am autistic and that many things people dislike about me are actually my autism has been life-changing. I am still working with the TEACCH Center to get an official assessment, but so far, 4 doctors have confirmed and diagnosed me. I have spoken with them and am on their waitlist. It is the only option I can afford to get the care I need."**

üíõ **I am terrified to tell anyone about this diagnosis or anything regarding my health. I fear the feedback, criticism, and honestly, I'm terrified someone will say something so wrong that I won't bounce back from it due to lack of understanding. I can no longer tolerate being berated because I struggle with communication or being told I'm selfish due to my inability to listen better in conversations. I have always been trying my hardest to do these things, but I just can't, and now I'm starting to understand why.**

**The one time I mentioned it to a family member did not end well, so I am utterly at a loss. I don't think anyone truly understands the gravity of how dramatically my life has changed. I'm just trying to keep up myself while spending the majority of my time trying to prove or defend myself instead of getting the help I need.**

üíõ **I honestly feel there is far too much to explain about how difficult my life has been for the past 4 years. Just trying to put this together for family has taken 5 days, with very little sleep and massive anxiety. I struggle to call and make my doctor's appointments, and it's a huge challenge just to eat and sleep each day (which most of the time I don't do either). Living with autism for 43 years without knowing it has led to a lot of masking, and that's all I know. It has caused me so much intense physical pain and damage that I don't have a choice but to accept this diagnosis, as it provides many answers and hopefully some support**

üíõ **Here are some links in case you're curious. Please be patient and understand that I'm trying very hard every day to survive and figure all this out so I can maybe return to participating in the world again. I want nothing more than to make use of all my new skills, but every attempt to talk to a client has led to extreme autistic meltdowns where I would lose my vision and no longer be able to speak at all, and Bryan had to contact clients for me (which felt awful)**

**I hope to get support from the TEACCH Center and the UMI Wellness Center to meet my basic needs (food, sleep, etc.) so that I can finally breathe. I intend to launch my business as an autistic designer and developer to help narrow down my client pool and stay in a super supportive community where I think I'll feel safe to prosper. There's just so much to figure out and wrap my head around, and I haven't even gotten close to seeing the actual doctors I need to, once again.**

üíõ **My main goal is to get into the TEACCH Center, as they provide free adult autism assessments and other resources. They are one of the nation's leading research centers on Autism (an extension of UNC Chapel Hill). I'm also trying to find out how to do genetic testing (which is another service they offer). My GP informed me that most geneticists and doctors won't even test for EDS since there's no specific treatment, although I did ace the hyper mobility test like a champ so I was already diagnosed with Hypermobility Syndrome. (So crazy my cool  backwards elbow trick is actually what got me diagnosed)**

<aside>
üíõ **In order to get my official Autism assessment I need a ton of information from a family member and there are forms for family members to fill out. There are a lot of questions about the age I started to walk and eat, what pregnancy with me was like, etc that I obviously don‚Äôt have the answers to. I need any childhood report cards or assessments from school and I am trying to get my records from Greenville Pediatrics and whomever I saw as a child when my hair fell out. I also desperately need to get my records from Dr Duncan who did  my first ADHD assessment that basically already shows I am autistic just with those finding alone (very high IQ with a reading comprehension learning disability). 

When I was assessed, the DSM diagnostic manual did not say that one could be ADHD and Autistic, that was changed in 2019, which is why you are seeing such a major increase in autism diagnosis lately (not because people want to be cool or get attention like the internet says). I have no idea how to do theses things and even the thought of trying to reach out to obtain these things is terrifying. This is definitely where I could use som help from my family.**

üíõ **Feb 14, 2017 is the day I went to the GP in Huntersville and told her there was absolutely something wrong with my body. She ordered scans of my back (that led to spinal fusion surgery) and scans of my eye (which discovered Grave‚Äôs Disease). 

So it has been 7 YEARS that I have been actively fighting to be heard by doctors. 

I have ALWAYS known something was off with my body. When I was 22 in the hospital for starvation, i made them x ray the ‚Äúhorn‚Äù in my chest that was protruding and everyone told me it was nothing. I told them then I thought I had autoimmune disease and have been telling doctors ever since that there was something more going on with me.  I am so tired of fighting just to not hurt. I dream often about the greatest piece of technology that could be made which would be a scan of some sort that would actually show your pain levels because pain can only really be assessed based on patient‚Äôs words and descriptions of it and since that never worked for me, I dream of there being some sort of test that could actually show doctors the intense amount of pain I live with everyday.**
