Chapter 38: Tethered Cord Syndrome in EDS - Clinical Overview

## Overview of Tethered Cord Syndrome (TCS)

TCS is a neurological condition that requires careful diagnosis through patient history and examination, often supported by MRI findings. The condition can present with various symptoms affecting mobility and bodily functions.

## Key Symptoms and Signs

- Back and leg pain (especially when climbing stairs)
- Progressive leg weakness
- Neurogenic bladder dysfunction
- Sexual dysfunction
- Rectal incontinence
- Decreased sensation in legs
- Positive stretch/traction sign (pain when raising legs)
- Orthopedic manifestations (scoliosis, hammertoes, high-arched feet)

## Diagnostic Considerations

Key diagnostic elements include:

- Clinical presentation and neurological examination
- MRI findings (may show low-lying conus at/below L2-3 disk space)
- Urodynamic studies showing detrusor/sphincter dyssynergia
- Note: In EDS patients, MRI may show normal conus position ("radiographically occult TCS")

## EDS and TCS Connection

Recent research has revealed important connections between EDS and TCS:

- Abnormal collagen structure in the filum terminale
- Inflammatory changes affecting filum elasticity
- Increased mechanical stress due to EDS hypermobility
- TCS is increasingly recognized as a potential comorbidity of EDS

## Treatment Approach

Surgical intervention through microsurgical resection of the filum terminale has shown positive outcomes:

- Improvement in mobility and strength
- Better bladder control and function
- Reduction in pain symptoms
- Potential for complete recovery in well-selected patients

## Differential Diagnosis

Other conditions to consider include:

- Multiple sclerosis
- Spinal cord tumors
- Congenital spine anomalies
- Cervical or thoracic instability
- Vascular malformations
- Viral or infectious etiologies

**Important Note:** The diagnosis of TCS in EDS patients often relies more heavily on clinical symptoms than imaging findings, as MRI may appear normal despite significant symptoms. Careful clinical evaluation and monitoring of symptom progression are essential for proper diagnosis and treatment planning.
