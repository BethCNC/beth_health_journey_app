- **The reason that any of this is relevant is to show you how much my physical appearance has drastically changed in the past three years and to further illustrate how this has seriously traumatized me and it has ALOT to do with my social anxiety and fear of speaking, being seen, social, media, etc.  No one has seen me looking like this. No one has seen me since I looked like I always did for 35 years.  The crazy and hella ironic thing about it is that at one point in my life I was genuinely considering writing a book called ‚ÄúCursed by Beauty‚Äù because I felt like my entire life had been based on my appearance and I was never seen for who I was nor given the opportunity or encouragement to advance my intelligence and knowledge.  I think one of the worst disservices that was done to me by my parents was not fostering and nurturing my brain and encouraging me to work and be smart.  I never heard anything like that.  My dad instead always told me he had enough money that I would never have to work a day in my life and he wanted us to be dependent on him totally as a means of control.**
- **I was always seriously triggered because I pretty much never went in public once without people staring, commenting, or even worse, making it a whole thing.  It made me avoid gas stations a several public places.  I genuinely hated it when people told me I was pretty.  What is even crazier is that I have thought I was fat, hideous, and terrible as long as I can remember and have never ever once approved of my appearance but it is pretty ironic that it was all taken away from me by my disease.**
- **I really really hope you don‚Äôt think I sound vain by saying all this.  That is precisely why I don‚Äôt really ever mention this to anyone.  It sounds totally vain.  But it isn‚Äôt.  I already had severe *body dysmorphic disorder* and have been anorexic and bulimic since the age of 10.  I was a cutter as well and always really excelled in finding ways to hurt or punish myself.**
- **I have suffered from suicidal idealizations pretty much my entire life.  I have had 3 suicide attempts and don‚Äôt really recall ever being happy or at peace in my life.  I know this sounds extreme but it is the truth.  I have been in therapy most of my life, in 3 mental institutions, countless testing, every medicine available, and at the end of the day my deep level of self hatred and self sabotage is on a level that has completely baffled most professionals.  The problem is I have continued to experience more trauma since then and I fully believe getting an autoimmune disease for me is yet another trauma.**
- **Side note: Deep down I believe my autoimmune disease is directly caused by my trauma and mental health.  No one in my family has autoimmune disease and that is pretty rare and I have had a few doctors mention that.**

### **The reason I even mention this is because THIS is what is causing my anxiety when it comes to speaking to you, anyone, and causing deep terrifying fear when I think of presenting myself to the world.  

This has been SOOOO hard to write and putting these pictures together was devastating to see it all side by side but I definitely already knew.  I avoid mirrors at all cost and don‚Äôt interact with any other humans other than Bryan.  

This is why I FREAKED out when my mom hired a photographer for Christmas because no one has seen me in 3 years and it is very obvious I look way different, way worse, and way sick.  If I am totally honest, I think I look deformed now and not even a resemblance of my old self.

I just think you should know and understand how big of an insecurity it is and it isn‚Äôt just simple shallow level vanity!!!**
