Disclosure • Training and Fellowship, Harvard Medical school • Weird Pain Medicine specialist • Assistant Professor – Brown Medical School, Rhode Island, USA • Special interest in complex pain conditions Connecting the dots • EDS is a complex condition • This presentation is about connecting the dots between all thesymptoms that come with having EDS. Three things to know in EDS 1. EDS is not a disease. It is a form of the human body. 2. Soft connective tissue 3. Poor joint position sense (proprioception) 4. Co-existing conditions (Mast cell activation, POTS, Chiari etc.,) Pain in EDS by body regions Pradeep Chopra, MD Pradeep Chopra, MD Common causes of headaches in EDS 1. Migraines 2. Chiari malformation 3. Cervicogenic Headaches – from muscles 4. Temporo Mandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ) 5. PoTS / Dysautonomia 7. Spontaneous CSF (Cerebrospinal) leak – low pressure inside the head 8. Cranio Cervical Instability (Instability of the neck and head) 9. Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (raised pressure insidethe head) Pradee Chopra, MDPradeep Chopra, MD “My head feels too heavy to hold up” Pradeep Chopra, MD 10 Chin poking forward position https://www.braceability.com/blogs/articles/text-neck-how-smartphones-hurt-your-spine Neck pain and headaches • A common cause of neck pain is posture, using a smart phone (“Texting neck”) • ‘Chin poking forward position’ • Before looking at other reasons, correct this first • If there are other reasons like cervical instability, Chiari malformation etc – these need to be addressed Pradeep Chopra, MDPradeep Chopra, MD Pain from a poor posture Pain from a poor posture 1 6 Pradeep Chopra, MD Common reasons for poor posture in EDS • Vision – Blurry vision.

Very common cause of low back pain • Usually around the lower back, radiates into the buttock region and may even go down the legs (but not below the knee) • Groin -occasionally • Leg length discrepancy LumboTrain® Lady – Dysautonomia / POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) Dysautonomia • This is a fancy name for a bunch of medical conditions that affect the nerves that control automatic functions in our body. • “Dysfunction of Autonomic Nervous System” • PoTS – Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome • Its one of the most common types seen in EDS Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) -Symptoms • Fainting, dizziness • Heart racing (Palpitations) • Fatigue • Headaches • Difficulty maintaining body temperature • Poor concentration “brain fog” • Feeling of constant anxiety • Stomach pain • Wake up feeling tired PoTS • Patients with EDS pool excessive blood to their lower extremities, • This triggers an increased activity in the same nervous system thatcontrols ‘fight or flight’ POTS -Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome Dysautonomia International for more information and high salt diet recipes. http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/ • EDS Awareness https://www.chronicpainpartners.com/ PoTS • The constant feeling of dizziness makes patients feel unstable • The laxity of the joints makes the muscles tighten reflexly • This constant imbalance of muscles worsens their pain and fatigue Anxiety in EDS •Patients with EDS and PoTS (Dysautonomia) are often over diagnosed to have anxiety •Symptoms of undiagnosed palpitations, fatigue, dizziness, chronic pain are attributed to ‘anxiety’. •In most cases its PoTS– its because of excessive activity of the flight or fight nerves to control blood pressure. • Increase in heart rate by 30 beats/min within 10 minutes of standing • heart rate of 120 beats / min within the first 10 minutes of standing • No significant change in blood pressure • Syncope or almost syncope (fainting) • In children an increase of 40 beats/minute Pradeep Chopra, MD 118 POTS -Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome POTS -tests • Orthostatics – Measure blood pressure and heart rate: • after lying supine for 5 minutes • standing up -immediately • Standing for 10 minutes • Q-sweat test • Tilt Table Test Sample readings in POTS Lying flat for 5 minutes 110/66 82 Standing, immediately 100/68 115 Standing

be because of other conditions such as Sjogrens syndrome, Antiphospholipid syndrome, celiac disease, anykylosing spondylitis. Myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis • Can be seen in Autoimmune conditions where patients develop antibodies to alpha 1, Beta 1, Beta 2 adrenergic receptors, muscarinic 3 receptors, (12)g-Acetylcholine receptors, cardiac lipid raft proteins. • These patients may respond well to IVIg infusions. Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) -Symptoms • Fainting, dizziness • Heart racing (Palpitations) • Fatigue • Headaches • Difficulty maintaining body temperature • Poor concentration “brain fog” • Feeling of constant anxiety • Stomach pain • Wake up feeling tired Mast Cell Activation Syndrome MCAS Pradeep Chopra, MD Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) • Mast cells are a type of cell found in the blood. • They are part of our body defense mechanism (immune system) • When they detect an attack (infection or something that is not good for the body) they get activated • Once mast cells get activated they release a bunch of chemicals suchas histamine, cytokines etc Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) • In MCAS, mast cells are inappropriately triggered and release excessive amount of these chemical mediators (histamine, cytokinesetc.) • It is NOT mastocytosis (whole different condition) Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) • Rashes, hives, itchy • Fatigue, tiredness • Muscle pain • Bone and joint pain • Abdominal pain, bloating, nausea • Palpitations, pre-syncope • Flushing especially after a hot shower • Constant feeling of having flu Dermatographism (writing on skin) Urticaria Multiforme -Scientific Figure on ResearchGate. Available from: https://www.researchgate.net/Dermatographism-Linear-wheals-afterwriting-on-the-skin_fig4_236106893 [accessed 3 Oct, 2018] Pradeep Chopra, MD Mast Cells Courtesy Ann Maitland, MD Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) • Rashes, hives, itchy • Fatigue, tiredness • Muscle pain • Bone and joint pain • Abdominal pain, bloating, nausea • Palpitations, pre-syncope • Flushing especially after a hot shower • Constant feeling of having flu MCAS – Testing • Tests for MCAS are NOT reliable. However, these test can be done: • Urine 24 hour collection for N-methylhistamine. • Same 24 hour collection Prostaglandin D2/F2 or 11 Beta prostaglandin F, whichever is available. • Serum tryptase. • Serum Chromogranin A level MCAS -tests • The diagnosis of MCAS depends largely on a physician who knows MCAS and is clinical • Laboratory tests are very difficult and unreliable. • If a biopsy sample is taken from endoscopy then: Please request Pathologist for the following: • Number of Mast Cells per high power field. • Stain for Mast Cells with CD117. • Comment on the morphology and histology. • Request KIT-D816V mutation analysis by PCR MCAS – treatment • Ranitidine (Zantacâ) 150mg twice a day. • Loratidine (Claritinâ) one tablet twice a day. • Cetrizine (Zyrtecâ) 10mg one tablet twice a day. • Clemastine 2mg p.o. b.i.d. • Rupatadine 10mg p.o. b.i.d. • Quercetin 1000 mg / day • Consider Ketotifen. • Consider Cromolyn oral 200mg four times a day. • Cromolyn Nebulized. • Avoid triggers for Mast cell activation such as NSAIDs, alcohol, opioids and sudden temperature changes. • Inactive ingredients (binding agents, preservatives) in pills may contribute to MCAS. • Consider a leukotriene inhibitor such as Singulair. • Low histamine diet. • Review and change possible hidden food sources and the possibility ofaccidental exposure to such foods. • Some of the usual suspects for MCAS to avoid are: • Seasonings (except olive oil, salt). • All dairy. • Eggs. • Grains except quinoa and rice. • Avoid beef products but okay to take lamb, venison and poultry. • Food and drug reactions are a common cause of unexplained hives andrashes. Some of the other causes of hives may be exposure to change intemperature (hot to cold), rubbing skin, physical exertion, pressure and directexposure to sunlight. • Other methods to avoid exacerbation maybe: • Use pollen guards in windows. • HEPA air filters, A/C. • Use a mask (e.g. VOG mask) while dusting or vacuuming. • Avoid long baths or showers, rapid changes in temperature, wool, dust and cigarette smoke. • May use nasal saline during flare ups MCAS – treatment MCAS – treatment MCAS – treatment Abdominal Pain Abdominal pain • Very common in EDS • Slowing down of the intestines • Alternating diarrhea and constipation • PoTS, MCAS –causes nausea, acid reflux, bloating and constipation • Prolapse • Acid reflux from MCAS • Low FODMAP diet – for bloating, pain and diarrhea • Treating PoTS and Mast Cell Activation Syndrome helps • In case you are wondering: • FODMAP -Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides And Polyols Low FODMAP diet • https://www.kcl.ac.uk/lsm/research/divisions/dns/projects/fodmaps/faq.aspx • There are 3 stages to the low FODMAP diet: • Stage 1: Restriction: In this stage, you reduce your FODMAP intake by avoiding foods that are high in FODMAPs for four to eight weeks as this period is considered long enough toidentify if symptoms will respond to a low FODMAP diet. • Stage 2: Reintroduction: If your symptoms have improved following FODMAP restriction,it is important to reintroduce some high FODMAP foods. This will enable you to identifywhich FODMAPs you are most sensitive to, as well as how much of a high FODMAP foodtriggers your symptoms. • Stage 3: Personalization: The long term aim of a low FODMAP diet is to personalize yourdiet so you only avoid foods that trigger your symptoms and you return to as normal adiet as possible. 54 1Dysfunction of movement of intestines • Can lead to changes in the gut microbiome (the helpful bacteria thatlive in our intestines) • Problems with movement of intestines may lead to Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth symptoms • Abdominal pain/discomfort • Bloating • Diarrhea • Weakness • gassy SIBO – problems • Weight loss • Vitamin deficiency – A,D,E,K, B12, • Vitamin excess – Folate • Iron deficiency • Low protein SIBO – testing • Organisms in the intestine produce hydrogen and methane. • Breath test can detect levels of hydrogen and methane • Elevated methane levels can be treated with statins (lovastatin – red rice yeast) • Treat any dysautonomia • Treat any MCAS • Treat constipation • Drugs for improving GI motility (Resolor, Iberogast, Mestinon, erythromycin) SIBO – treatment • Elevated methane levels can be treated with statins (lovastatin – red rice yeast) • Specific antibiotics to treat SIBO. • Be cautious of repeating antibiotics • Treat any dysautonomia • Treat any MCAS • Treat constipation • Drugs for improving GI motility (Resolor, Iberogast, Mestinon) SIBO – treatment • Avoid simple carbohydrates • Think of pureed foods. Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome MALS Pradeep Chopra, MD Abdominal pain – MALS • Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome (MALS). • Belly pain after eating food. • Can trigger PoTS Abdominal pain – MALS • There is an artery that supplies blood to part of the intestine • It is called Celiac Artery • This artery pokes out from under a ligament called Median Arcuate ligament • There are 2 theories about why MALS causes pain • The median arcuate ligament is tight causing compression of the celiac artery • There is a nerve in that area called Celiac ganglion which may be getting compressed or inflamed. Abdominal pain – MALS • Treatment is surgical decompression • If treated early, symptoms resolve • If treated late, may need IVIg infusion Pelvic pain Pelvic pain in EDS -Dysmenorrhea (painful menstrual periods) • Birth control to stop periods – may help with joint laxity also • NSAID’s (ibuprofen, naproxyn) • Control Mast Cell Activation Syndrome Pelvic pain in EDS -Interstitial cystitis (bladder pain) • Maybe part of Mast Cell Activation syndrome • Cromolyn or Ketotifen • Palmitoyl ethanolamide (PEA) • Maybe part of Mast Cell Activation syndrome • Benadryl douche or cream • Cromolyn douche or cream Pelvic pain in EDS – Vulvodynia (vaginal pain) EDS and children 1 6 1 Pradeep Chopra, MD EDS and children • dislocated joints, • chronic body wide pain • Easy bruising • Abdominal pain • Fatigue • Unidentified bleeding (intracranial, abdominal) • To the ER physicians they look suspicious of Medical Child abuse • The diagnosis of Conversion Disorder or Munchausen by Proxy areoften made by providers with little training in Psychiatry and viceversa most psychiatrists have no training in pain conditions. • Parents – please research the facility carefully before taking your child there. • The facility should have trained physicians in EDS and itscomplications • There are some hospitals that have hired “Medical Child Abuse” specialists. Behavioral • To diagnose a child with Conversion disorder or Munchausen by Proxy without a dedicated multidisciplinary team approach and withoutconcrete evidence is extremely harmful to the patient. • To label an adult with pain as being psychological is severely harmful. It closes all doors to correct treatment. Misdiagnosis • Please check with other patients to get feedback before you go to a hospital. • If you sense that the doctors are skeptical of your complaints, consider going somewhere else. • When you go to an a academic hospital, chances are that you will be seen by a junior doctor / Resident – who is the least qualified to manage complex medical conditions. • If you are able, choose a Concierge physician. Service Dogs -invaluable • POTS – they can sense when their owner is having an episode ofdizziness or seizure • EDS and pain -they protect the limb from being injured or touched • Helps boost confidence in their owners, making them more independent • Help with balance, call for help, open doors, switch on lights, pullwheelchairs, anxiety, Some organizations that can help get a service dog • https://www.pawswithacause.org • http://www.neads.org • http://freedomservicedogs.org To manage pain first find out what’s broken • It is crucial to understand the cause of the pain before deciding ontreatment options. • For example, pain in the shoulder joint can be from: • Dislocated shoulder joint, • Muscle spasms • Nerve or blood vessel impingement or damage • All of the above • The treatment of each of these is different 168 Types of tissue injury in EDS • Micro trauma – small repetitive traumas resulting in constant tissue breakdown. Invisible tissue breakdown. This is far more common. For example – overstretching muscles and ligaments. Vacuuming, chopping food, dusting • Macro trauma – a large event or trauma resulting in injury. For example -Dislocation or fracture Pradeep Chopra, MD 169 Macro trauma Micro trauma Principles of managing pain in EDS •Use a mix of treatments •For example -Knee pain due to instability • Stabilize knee with braces • Strengthen muscles around the knee • Medications – NSAID’s, topical etc. • Follow the NC10 rule (if you can get at least 10% from one treatment, five such treatments will give you 50% relief) 171Joint Position sense Proprioception The body’s ability to sense movement of the joints and their position Pradeep Chopra, MD Proprioception (Joint Position Sense) • Proprioception, also known as Joint Position Sense, is the ability of a joint to 1. determine its position, 2. detect movement, and 3. sense of resistance to force Proprioception – Joint sense • The brain constantly gets information from the joints as to the exact position of the limbs in space. • It helps us walk, use our arms, maintain our posture without tipping over. • Protects our joints from over extending and our muscles from over stretching • EDS – poor proprioception.
