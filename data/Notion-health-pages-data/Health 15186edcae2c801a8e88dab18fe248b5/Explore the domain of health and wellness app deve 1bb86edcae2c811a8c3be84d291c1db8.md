## How Can You Monetize Your Wellness App?

Health and wellbeing apps monetize similarly to regular apps but with specific considerations. Here are the main ways to make money from health and wellness apps.

### Freemium monetization model

Freemium app revenue models provide users with a free version of the app and offer additional features, such as a broader range of workouts, diet plans, and techniques, for a fee. For instance, **the Headspace app** offers a free version of its sleep and meditation app that includes basic meditation exercises.

This model has proven effective in attracting a significant user base and generating awareness for newly emerging products. A potential disadvantage of the freemium model is that it can rapidly deplete a company's cash reserves by accommodating many non-paying customers. In this situation, app owners should carefully evaluate the time, resources, and financial investment required to convert free users to paid users and assess the potential for reaching a point of balance.

### Subscription-based monetization

Subscription-based app revenue models typically require users to pay a recurring fee to access the app's content or features. Many health and wellness apps offer monthly and annual plans and a free 7-day trial to encourage users to subscribe.

Subscription models provide a more significant amount of high-value content compared to freemium models. One of the popular weight loss apps, **Noom**, provides subscribers with various weight loss programs that can be customized to meet individual needs. The app offers expert advice, nutrition lessons, food logging, recipes, meal planning, and exercise recommendations.

### In-app ads model

Health and wellness apps can generate revenue through advertising in the following way: advertisers pay to display their ads to your users, providing a simple way to earn money. Standard ads, shown to all users, are less expensive than customized ads that target specific themes to specific individuals. For instance, the **Fitbit fitness app** implements this strategy by showing users ads from fitness and wellness brands.

In-app advertising is crucial because it helps app developers make income, companies reach their target audience, and users find new items and services that are relevant to them.

We’ve presented some of the most widespread monetization models you can use for your wellness app development. So, how to monetize your app appropriately and what model to choose? It depends on your particular business, the app type you have in mind, and the feature list you plan. However, based on our experience in software development, we should mention that you should plan a monetization strategy before your wellness solution creation for faster profits.

## Wellness Application Integrations

If you want to enhance your wellness app user experience, consider integrations to include in your solution. To make your planning process smoother, we’ve prepared a list of integrations you can consider.

### Health Kit/Google Fit integrations

You can integrate your wellness app with the Health Kit (iOS) or Google Fit (Android) platforms to assist users in consolidating their health and wellness data, including activity, nutrition, sleep, and more, from various sources into your app. This provides a holistic view of their well-being.

Currently, our team works on a SaaS-based fitness platform that aligns personal trainers and fitness enthusiasts in offline and virtual workout activities. One of the project’s requirements is **to integrate the solution with iOS HealthKit and Google Fit**, so the users can track the live health and fitness data toward defined goals. The system also implies adding the **Nutritionix API** (large weight nutrition database) for food tracking capabilities. The solution is in development.

### Nutrition tracking and recipe platform integration

Integrating nutrition trackers like MyFitnessPal or Lose It! allows users to easily log and monitor their calorie intake, nutrient consumption, and other important dietary information (e.g., nutrition goals and helpful tips). You can also use a nutrition database API like the [USDA Food Database](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/) or [Nutrionix](https://www.nutritionix.com/). Users can log their meals by searching for specific foods or scanning barcodes. The integration provides nutritional information, including calories, macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals, helping users make informed dietary choices.

Moreover, you can connect with recipe platforms like Yummly or Allrecipes to promote healthy eating habits and facilitate ration planning. Users can discover healthy recipes, import ingredients into their shopping lists, and receive cooking instructions.

### Fitness tracker and social media implementation

You can use popular fitness trackers like Fitbit, Apple Watch, or Garmin for your app to integrate with. It allows users to sync their workout data, step counts, heart rate, and sleep patterns from their wearable devices to your app. Furthermore, the users can track their progress, set goals, and receive personalized insights based on their fitness data.

Care about social media implementation and fitness tracker integration for your health and wellness app development. It will enable your app users to share their achievements, workouts, or healthy meals on social media platforms.

### Third-party API integration for custom workouts

Utilize workout-related APIs to offer custom workout plans to allow the users of your wellness app to input their fitness goals, preferences, and available equipment. This way, your app will be able to generate tailored workout routines and track progress over time.

### Health blogs and podcasts integration

You can also implement curated health and wellness content from reputable blogs or podcasts. Thus, people will be able to access articles, videos, or audio content related to fitness, nutrition, mental health, and more, all within your app.

### Mental health and sleep tracking integrations

Mental health trackers like Moodpath or Headspace can be integrated to provide users with more support and insight into their well-being. Due to this integration, they can monitor their moods, thoughts, and feelings daily to get an overall picture of their mental health.

Mental health is deeply connected with the person's sleeping habits, so you can also implement sleep trackers like Beddit or Sleep Cycle to help users understand their sleeping habits and set customized sleep goals. Moreover, you can choose SleepScore or Oura Ring monitoring integrations to allow people to track their sleep quality.

So, what integration to take? The answer to this question lies in your target audience’s needs and the purpose of the wellness app you would like to build. If you are in doubt, our specialists will help you find the answers. Moreover, we’ll render top-quality Discovery Phase Services and advise you on a fitting feature list for your app, and compile a rough estimate for budget planning .

## Wellness App Development Cost

The wellness app building price can greatly vary depending on the app type, the number of integrations, features and its complexity, software developers’ rates, etc. That’s why the exact cost is hard to estimate right from the start: the specialists should know all the requirements to the product to give you the answer. To give you a hint, the wellness app development cost range is **$55,000 - $100,000+**.

Planning to build wellness software, pay attention to outsourcing software development as a cost-effective and reliable way to build your own app. Then, choose a company from a preferred region and start working with them.

To simplify your region choice, we’ve prepared a map with hourly wages for software development services across popular IT outsourcing destination.

Outsourcing hourly rates for software development by the region

Looking through the given map, you can see the hourly rates differ from country to country. This way, the software engineers in North America and Australia have the highest wages for an hour of their job. However, the price doesn’t mean that the quality of the developed product will be equally high. You can get a qualitative product for less money.

The Central and Eastern Europe region has recommended itself as an outsourcing destination with a good value for money. For example, if you outsource to Estonia, you will discover that this country offers an advantageous quality-price ratio as Estonian IT experts offer high-quality software development services. Their expertise enables them to create and release healthcare software solutions of any complexity.

The Estonian developers also have high English proficiency, guaranteeing your communication with the outsourcing IT vendor will be seamless and lead to productive collaboration results.
