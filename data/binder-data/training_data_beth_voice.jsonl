{"prompt": "Unfortunately my life has been filled with traumatic and terrifying events that have absolutely shaped the person I am today. The earliest memory I actually have of this intense discomfort, anxiety, and sadness, and where I think my journey of becoming a people pleaser began would be around age 10. At this time in my life my parents finally got separated for the first time (there would be 3 times in total before their ultimate divorce when I was an adult). All I really remember is that my dad moved out and we were told not to tell anyone about what was going on; not family members, friends, no one. I also have a vivid life lasting memory from that year of my paternal grandmother pulling me to the side when we arrived for our family Christmas gathering that year and telling me very clearly to[><]This memory has obviously stuck with me and definitely was woven into what became my one true core value I’ve held onto throughout life. It is worth mentioning here a little about my dad, his family, and the huge impact he and their values played in my life. My dad and his family are plagued with mental health issues. My dad himself is a diagnosed narcissist with a sex addiction with a perpetual weakness for objectifying women. Not only was my dad really consumed with my outer appearance and presenting me to the world as his “perfect looking daughter”, he was unapologetically inappropriate with almost every female he came in contact with. For instance, If we went out to eat together as a family and were seated in a restaurant by the hostess, my dad would immediately start scanning the room and we would very often get up and move tables (without even being polite and asking the hostess /server we currently had) to sit at a table with a more attractive server so he could flirt with them the whole time. I have memories of my dad getting women’s phone numbers right in front of my mom and I and I also had several friends always express their discomfort around my dad. This has always been difficult for me to process even into adulthood because my dad was never inappropriate with me in sexually abusive manor, but I do have vivid memories of extreme physical discomfort from my dad’s weird over affection towards me in public. Instances like wanting to hold my hand (in what felt to me the way a couple would) to walk around the mall or church or how in church he ALWAYS had to sit next to me and put his arm around me or somehow physically touch me. Just writing this I can feel my shoulders start to shrink and re coil like they always would and I would sit there feeling very uncomfortable and never uttered a word to anyone. Even now, I feel awful if I talk bad about my father though because although the man is absolutely certifiably a full blown narcissist (he even has brain scans showing how his brain has completely changed in his life which is so so crazy to me) and he can be very toxic and damaging, he is also loyal and unconditional with his love for me and I truly value that. His story is very crazy but he went from being a mega millionaire to now having nothing financially so finally our relationship has shifted. My dad’s big way of showing love my entire life was with gift. He bought me my first business at 22 and loved nothing more than a big extravagant gift that made him look like the greatest dad alive. Now that he is “broke” he is really trying to show up in other ways and although I don’t open up to anyone much and definitely keep everyone at a very far distance, we are slowly trying to work on our relationship and he has really shown up for me on this particular journey. Out of anyone in my family, my Dad for sure has the best business mindset and he at one point was the editor for Quarter Horse Journal Magazine so he has the most understanding of what graphic design is. He actually tested me last night asking me what Bank I was currently banking with as he knows I am trying to figure that out an I am sure he is trying to see what he can do. He has a lot of connections at his local branch of the same bank I bank at (because he used to be on the board.) I just don’t fully trust him in the sense that I always expect him to have the best intentions but I also never believe anything he says as far as promises until it actually happens. Meaning, I don’t allow myself to get my hopes up anymore for sure! The next big chunk of things in life that have had a big impact would be all the sexual assault, harassment, and abuse that I have experienced. This is a topic I don’t discuss often and I probably won’t go into too much detail because I think can go unsaid the impact these things had on me. I have done a ton of work to try to understand why I always ended up in these situations and of course being a people pleaser is the root of it. The problem was that I wasn’t special in that I kept ending up in certain situations, it was more that most people would pack their shit and hit the ground running as soon as someone they were in a relationship with did something terrible, hateful, and unequivocally wrong, but my insecurities and inner uncertainties allowed me to constantly adjust my morals and values to adjust and fit each situation. I allowed numerous terrible things to occur to me, and would continue to allow them as a way of self punishment. I again want to keep this brief and not spiral here but this stared with Abusive Boyfriend #1 from college at UNCW. He was awful and it ended with a retraining order he constantly ignored and ultimately he called my dad and said he was on his way to my apartment with a gun and three bullets. He said he had one for our dog, one for me and one for him. My dad immediately called the police and drove himself the airport where he boarded our private plane and was at my door in 20 minutes. They were able to stop my ex entering the complex and he did indeed have a gun with not 3 but 5 bullets. My things were packed and I was brought home and hospitalized for starvation. I had completed all of my classes for my first degree in exercise physiology because I was on the path to be a physical therapist. I ended up not graduating because my parents would not allow me to go back to that town to complete my internship. This cycle pretty much repeated itself 3 good times after this one. The next big impact moment would be my high school boyfriend, and first love getting a brain tumor and passing away 3 months later while I was with him. This happened while my parents were in the depths of their divorce so I went to Mike’s funeral and then got on a plane and went to family week at my dad’s sex addiction rehab with the family. Ever since this moment my life has been a total whirlwind I have been trying to catch up with. Not long after this is when I met Bryan. We have been together ten years and he is my north star. He is my constant and my security for sure. We had a 3 year break at one point and it is during that time I was abducted at gun point and held against my will and sex trafficked for ten days. I escaped on my own in the woods and never told the police or hardly anyone out of my shame. My mom’s first words were, I am sure you were wearing something that made them think you may be interested.” This led to a deep spiral of depression, drugs, suicide attempts, cutting, you name it, I tried it. I obviously was doing anything in the world to numb the pain. I have tried to stay busy and move forward until I got sick 4 years ago. I got my first suggestion of autoimmune disease in my 20s right before my boyfriend passed away when I tested positive for rheumatoid factor. I put it on the back burner and it all came back loud and clear 4 years ago. My knee swelled up to the size of a watermelon and stayed that way for a year while a nasty staph infection ate away at my face aggressively and I was sick in every other way possible. I quit working two years ago when my mom offered to financial support me due to my health and that is ultimately what led me here. I turned to my computer as a source of keeping my mind occupied and fell in love with everything design.”, “completion”: “”}
{“prompt”: “Dear Mom,\nGood morning…well afternoon now that I am still typing this at 4pm,\nThank you for reaching out. congratulations on setting the wedding date! I’m genuinely happy for you and Donnie, and I hope the planning process has brought and will bring you both joy and excitement.\nI want to take this opportunity to be honest about where I am in my life right now. As you know, It’s been a challenging journey, filled with chronic illness, severe social anxiety, PTSD, and financial stress. These battles have made each day incredibly tough to navigate.\nWhile I understand the desire for everything to appear fine, it’s important to acknowledge that it’s not. Pretending otherwise only adds to the weight I’m already carrying.\nThe pressure to “just show up, smile, laugh, and leave” has become impossible to maintain so absence has become my only option.\nRecently, I was diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum, shedding light on many aspects of my life that have always made me feel different. My obsessive habits and anxiety issues have been lifelong companions, shaping my experiences profoundly.\nOur conversations often don’t go the way you’d like them to because it feels like you don’t genuinely want to understand my world. It’s painful for me to feel this lack of understanding and support, especially during such times of struggle.\nI’m also facing challenges in my professional life. My anxiety has reached a point where engaging with clients or handling basic business tasks leads to severe panic attacks. Even something as straightforward as filing taxes became a monumental challenge that ended me in the doctor’s office yesterday due to the extreme stress and anxiety regarding my financial issues with my family in the past. It is impossible not to want to give up at least hourly with all the obstacles I constantly face trying to get ahead, which doesn’t make me special in any way, it is just extremely hard.\nI want you to know that I’m not deliberately withholding the “polished up” version of myself. My goal is to reach a point where I can accept myself for who I am, flaws and all, and then share that person with my family and friends. But I’m not there yet, and I need time and support to work through these struggles. There are so many things no one knows about me because no one has had the time to ask me anything about my life and my hopes and dreams but regardless the past 4 years have involved immense self work, treatment, self discovery and self care.\nI hope you can understand where I’m coming from and offer your support as I continue on this journey of healing and discovery. I have sent you emails in the past regarding our financial agreement that I don’t believe you have seen or read but know my intent has always been to communicate openly and honestly about where I am and what is happening and to never allow it to be a situation of unfairness or enabling. If I could figure out a way to mentally and physically keep it all together to make just enough money to help support my little family, then all would be well in my world. I hate nothing more than the situation I am in financially and it is a burden and stress in my life every second of every single day in ways I am not sure you can even comprehend.\nRegarding the wedding, I understand there is probably a desire for me to participate, or at least show up and pretend like all is well in our world, but I believe there’s a lot of work, healing, and open communication needed for me to do so without causing further damage to myself and our relationship, physically, emotionally, and mentally. It’s crucial for us to find a way forward that is supportive and respectful of both of our needs. I feel that involving a professional in our communications could help our conversations be less destructive and more productive and I am willing to work to find a way to make this happen and open to whatever feedback you may have.”, “completion”: “”}
{“prompt”: “Hi Mom,\nIt hurts when I reach out and you immediately criticize me. Instead, asking about my autism diagnosis, health conditions and social anxiety would be much more supportive. It feels like you don’t understand the challenges I face and have no interest in trying. If you don’t want to know the truth, why ask how I’m doing? This alone causes me to resist reaching out to you as I know I am fragile and not complete yet and I know I can’t handle all the constant complaints about me so I just avoid to protect myself.\nEvery time I try to be honest, my efforts are dismissed as “too long,” “too short,” “too much”, “too little” etc. Conditional support, where my communication dictates your approval, which then dictates whether I can buy groceries for the month, hurts me deeply.\nThe financial help you’ve provided these past years has been essential. However, it feels conditional, making it hard to accept freely. I need your understanding and validation, not judgment for struggling to communicate.\nThere were never any “contracts.” I simply want you to see things from my perspective and to see that I’ve kept my word and pursued a career despite my disabilities with no deviations from that path at all. However, I feel like it’s “not good enough” because I lack a bank account, don’t have income or clients, and just can’t do it fast enough to make money without a breakdown. Is my worth dependent on my bank balance? When I can finally communicate freely, will my voice finally matter?\nHere’s the crux of the issue: You see my communication struggles as a lack of gratitude. They’re not related. Communication is a two-way street. No one has ever created a safe space for me to share my struggles without judgment. My experiences have taught me that seeking support when overwhelmed makes me seem “spoiled” or “entitled.”\nMy goal remains the same: to live a fulfilling life despite my limitations, not feeling defeated constantly; and to use my business and art to spread the message to every little girl on this planet, “That you are enough just as you are, always have been, and always will be.”\n\nLove,\nBeth”, “completion”: “”}
