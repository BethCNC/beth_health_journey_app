5. **Consider adding a style guide** for maintaining this organization

## Files That May Need Import Updates

Check these files for import paths that might need updating:
- Components importing from old `assets/` paths
- Any references to removed directories in code
- Image references that were moved to `public/images/`
- Data processing scripts that reference moved directories
